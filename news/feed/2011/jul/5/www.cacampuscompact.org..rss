    <description> &lt;h3&gt;
	Monologues tell women&amp;#39;s stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Vagina Monologues returns to CSU Monterey Bay Feb.12, 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Event flier&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/vm_15_poster_for_web.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:350px; height:506px; float:right&quot; /&gt;The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the Vagina Monologues tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world. CSUMB&amp;#39;s production is directed and produced by students &amp;ndash; Andrea Valenzuela and Marisa Herrera-Keehn, respectively &amp;ndash; and features 28 student actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monologues dive into the mystery, humor, pain, power, wisdom, outrage and excitement buried in women&amp;rsquo;s experiences. They address issues such as rape, birth, sex and relationships; some are serious, some are funny, all are enlightening and explore new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine&amp;#39;s Day. The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about violence against women. The proceeds will be donated to Women Alive, an emergency shelter in Salinas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s production will feature five new monologues. Parents, please note the mature content and graphic language used in the play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The play&amp;#39;s staging at CSUMB is part of V-Day&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/23/csumb-joins-worldwide-protest-violence-against-women&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One Billion Rising&lt;/a&gt; campaign, a global call for women survivors of violence and those who love them to gather and release their stories through art, dance, marches, ritual, song and testimonies. V-Day&amp;#39;s mission: to celebrate women and girls and to stop the sexual violence being perpetrated against them all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CSUMB joins worldwide protest of violence against women</title>
    <link>http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/23/csumb-joins-worldwide-protest-violence-against-women</link>
    <description> &lt;p&gt;
	Students at CSU Monterey Bay will gather on Feb. 13 to protest sexual violence toward women across the globe as part of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onebillionrising.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One Billion Rising&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;logo&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/logo_for_web.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:221px; height:155px; float:left&quot; /&gt;A variety of campus organizations &amp;ndash; the Title IX Task Force, the University Police Department, Associated Students, the Asian Pacific Islander Association, the Music and Performing Arts Department and Sodexo, among others &amp;ndash; are sponsoring the event, which will be held in the main quad from 2 to 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One Billion Rising&amp;rdquo; was initiated by Eve Ensler, the creator of &amp;ldquo;The Vagina Monologues&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; which is performed at CSUMB every year on or around Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. This year&amp;rsquo;s production is scheduled for Feb. 12, 13 and 14 at 8 p.m. in the World Theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the One Billion Rising website, the protest was inspired by the statistic that one in three women on the planet will be raped or beaten, which equals 1 billion women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the inaugural events on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day 2013, men and women around the world gathered to dance in protest of this statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The university will take part in the campus version of the movement, which focuses on stopping sexual violence on campuses, increasing awareness, and focusing on making student safety a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;CSUMB and the surrounding community will rise in unity to dance and sing with a singular voice to demand an end to sexual and gender violence in own community,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Bartkowski, a deputy Title IX officer at CSUMB.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Alum documents Carmel Mission restoration</title>
    <link>http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/22/alum-documents-carmel-mission-restoration</link>
    <description> &lt;h3&gt;
	Preview set for Feb. 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;rsquo;s canonization of Father Serra may help filmmaker Doug Mueller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mueller (TAT, 2003) is seeking support to complete a documentary film on the restoration and seismic retrofit of the Carmel Mission Basilica. Father Serra founded the mission and is buried there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Carmel Mission restoration is subject of alum&amp;#039;s documentary&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/carmel_mission_restoration_main_476x268.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:400px; height:225px; float:right&quot; /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get it funded so it can be finished by September,&amp;rdquo; Mueller said. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a big incentive now, before Father Serra is sainted and people flock to the mission.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the Carmel Mission Foundation, which hired Mueller, an important part of the basilica&amp;rsquo;s restoration is his record of the project. The film examines the daily construction work over a six-month period and highlights the most complex tasks as they change over time. People who worked on the project discuss the challenges of restoring one of the oldest and most historically significant buildings in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The San Francisco Film Society is providing fiscal oversight, which allows donations to be tax deductible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sffs.org/filmmaker360/documentary-grants-and-programs/project-development-and-fiscal-sponsorship/carmel-mission-restoration#.VMFCPf06BDM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Learn more about the documentary here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Doug Mueller&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/douglas_mueller_headshot_122x155.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:122px; height:155px; float:right&quot; /&gt;Footage from the documentary will be screened at a preview from 5 to 6:30 p.m., Feb. 13, in Crespi Hall, located behind the mission on Lasuen Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mueller is also finishing work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUiWUabng4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repatriation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a feature film he wrote and directed. Watch the trailer here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His film &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/news/2010/dec/15/another-csumb-alum-goes-indie-sundance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prairie Love,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a dark comedy about a nomad traveling the rural roads of North Dakota, had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CSUMB reaches out to black community through church visits</title>
    <link>http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/21/csumb-reaches-out-black-community-through-church-visits</link>
    <description> &lt;h3&gt;
	Super Sunday encourages more students to enroll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Parishioners at two local churches will get more than a sermon at the Feb. 8 services. They&amp;rsquo;ll get a pitch for the value of a college education &amp;ndash; straight from the pulpit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cal State Monterey Bay administrators will visit churches in Seaside that day as part of a California State University program called Super Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At 11:15 a.m., Vice President For Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs is scheduled to address the congregation at Greater Victory Temple. At 11 a.m., Associate Vice President for University Affairs Andre Lewis will speak at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;ow to Get to College brochure&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/how_to_get_to_college_for_web.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; width:400px; height:101px&quot; /&gt;They will discuss the importance of getting a college degree for today&amp;rsquo;s competitive job market, when to start planning for college, programs offered at CSUMB, financial aid and parent involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following the services, staff members from CSUMB and church education advisers will provide information on the application and admission process, including virtual tours through CSUmentor, the website that helps students apply for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the publications to be distributed during the visits is the &amp;ldquo;How to Get to College&amp;rdquo; poster, which provides middle and high school students and their parents with step-by-step information on the path to college. Members of each congregation also will hear about the CSU&amp;rsquo;s Early Assessment Program, a program enabling 11th graders to gauge their college readiness in English and math long before applying to the CSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now in its 10th year, Super Sunday is part of an educational outreach led by the CSU African American Initiative &amp;ndash; a partnership with churches &amp;ndash; to increase college preparation, student enrollment and graduation rates among African American students. More than 100 churches will host CSU representatives on Feb. 8, 15 and 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For more information, contact CSUMB&amp;rsquo;s Office of Admissions at 582-3738.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Students and instructors alike are effusive in their praise of Professor Villase&amp;ntilde;or&amp;rsquo;s work in support of student success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Provost Irwin went on to say, &amp;ldquo;She is present in the lives of her students and faculty colleagues, empowering them to thrive at CSUMB. She is a quintessential teacher, scholar and advocate for students.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	First-year seminars are designed to prepare students for academic and personal success. During the 2014-15 school year, 12 classes were offered with a variety of themes, including technology, sustainability, digital media arts, psychology and health and well-being.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to her work with the First-Year Seminar program, Dr. Villase&amp;ntilde;or teaches classes in the Division of Humanities and Communication in Chicano Studies and literature. She holds a Ph.D. in ethnic studies from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;br /&gt;

The festival will be held from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., Jan. 23, in Room 118 of the Media Learning Center. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 16-month program prepares students for positions in the fields of education and training. The coursework integrates instructional design, learning theory, information technology and media design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I enjoyed the program; it&amp;rsquo;s been a great experience,&amp;rdquo; said Callie Chastain, an analyst in CSUMB&amp;rsquo;s School of Business. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been hugely advantageous for me.&amp;rdquo; For her capstone, Chastain designed online modules for use by incoming students in the university&amp;rsquo;s Master of Business Administration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Students will receive their degrees at the May 16 commencement ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Native educator works to serve the needs of children</title>
    <link>http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/13/native-educator-works-serve-needs-children</link>
    <description> &lt;p&gt;
	Kathryn England-Aytes, a lecturer in psychology, has joined a newly created national organization that serves the needs of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Insert a description of the image here.&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kathrym_head_shot.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:250px; height:355px; float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sbgs.csumb.edu/faculty/kathryn-england-aytes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. England-Aytes&lt;/a&gt; will serve as a consultant with the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, an organization that provides information, resources and services relating to adoption, foster care and child welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Former Kinship Center CEO Carol Biddle is the managing director; Adam Pertman, former president of the Donaldson Adoption Institute, is the founder and president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Her work with the center &amp;ldquo;fits into my own research interests on historical trauma and links with contemporary behavior, particularly in educational settings, in Indian Country,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I believe this will also be a good fit with my work with the Native American Children&amp;rsquo;s Alliance (NACA), an inter-tribal nonprofit that works on child abuse prevention and intervention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a board member and trainer for NACA, she has given presentations on child forensic interviewing and cultural awareness in multidisciplinary team settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;As a Native educator, my goal is always to honor and integrate the cultures, values and traditions of Native students with learning opportunities for full participation in the larger community,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, Dr. England-Aytes made a presentation at the National Indian Nations Conference: Justice for Victims of Crime, held on the Agua Caliente reservation in Southern California. Along with co-presenters from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the South Dakota Highway Patrol and the National Children&amp;rsquo;s Alliance, she talked on &amp;ldquo;Building Resiliency in Child Abuse Organizations Working with Native Children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Teaching Truly book jacket&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/teaching_truly.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; width:101px; height:160px&quot; /&gt;And good reviews continue to be published about the book &amp;ldquo;Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education&amp;rdquo; by Four Arrows, to which Dr. England-Aytes contributed a chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to a review in Education Review/Rese&amp;ntilde;as Educativas, her chapter on historical trauma and its prevention in the classroom established the first and most critical part of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rape Crisis Center taps student&#039;s work for race logo</title>
    <link>http://news.csumb.edu/news/2015/jan/13/rape-crisis-center-taps-students-work-race-logo</link>
    <description> &lt;p&gt;
	As publicity kicks in for the annual Together with Love 5 and 10K run, colorful posters are popping up around the local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Race logo&quot; src=&quot;http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/twl_2015_design_final.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:350px; height:248px; float:left&quot; /&gt;The artwork was done by CSU Monterey Bay student Diana Mejia in Professor Bobbi Long&amp;rsquo;s introduction to digital graphic design class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the fifth year the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center, sponsor of the annual race that is held near Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, has worked with CSUMB to develop the logo that is used in marketing materials &amp;ndash; in print ads, on television, online and on coffee mugs &amp;ndash; and on the T-shirts given to race participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge for students is to come up with a design that combines the &amp;ldquo;Together with Love&amp;rdquo; theme, the date, MCRCC&amp;rsquo;s full name and the logo of the premier corporate sponsor, and communicates the purpose of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clare Mounteer, the center&amp;rsquo;s executive director, made several visits to the class to introduce the project and work with the students. &amp;ldquo;I must have seen hundreds of different design concepts,&amp;rdquo; she said, adding that she enjoys seeing the many ways students incorporate &amp;ldquo;so much creativity into their work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Students vote on the top designs; those designs are then presented to the MCRCC staff or board for final selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really fun to see how excited people get on race day when they first see the T-shirts,&amp;rdquo; Mounteer said, &amp;ldquo;and gratifying for the winning design student to see so many people actually wearing their artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We love this partnership with CSUMB and hope it goes on for many years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For three decades, the race has been the biggest annual fundraising event for the Rape Crisis Center, a nonprofit agency that advocates for and provides support for victims and survivors of sexual assault. The center also works to prevent sexual violence through education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The MCRCC isn&amp;rsquo;t the only community organization to benefit from the talents of Professor Long&amp;rsquo;s students. Members of her publications design class have been designing the poster and marketing materials for First Night Monterey since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;These projects give students real-world experience working with a client,&amp;rdquo; Professor Long said. &amp;ldquo;They learn business design practices and project management and acquire advanced digital production skills while creating professional quality projects for community clients,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
