	In recognition of his work to promote service learning and community-campus partnerships throughout the Monterey Bay and Salinas Valley, Seth Pollack has been named winner of the 2013 Richard E. Cone Award by California Campus Compact.</p>
<p>
	For more than 15 years, Dr. Pollack has been director of CSU Monterey Bay&rsquo;s Service Learning Institute. He has helped the university become a national leader in service learning and civic engagement.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Service learning and partnerships are part of the very fiber of our being as a campus, and that is due in large part to the continued leadership on the part of Dr. Pollack,&rdquo; said CSUMB Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe.<br />

	<strong>Lecturer&rsquo;s work include in MexiCali Biennial</strong><br />
	Juan Luna-Avin, a lecturer in Visual and Public Art, has a work included in the MexiCali Biennial, opening Jan. 19, at the Vincent Price Art Museum on the campus of East Los Angeles College.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Cannibalism in the New World&quot; is the theme of the exhibit. It features works by 33 artists from Mexico and California.<br />
	<br />
	While the title might conjure visions of Donner Party performance art, co-curator Ed Gomez told the L.A. Weekly the word &quot;cannibal&quot; has larger cultural implications, especially for Mexican society.<br />
	&quot;In colonial times during the conquest of Mexico, they believed that these heathens were worshipping pagan idols and practicing human sacrifice and forms of cannibalism,&quot; he says of how the Spanish viewed the natives. &quot;That became the justification and rationalization of the complete eradication and genocide of these indigenous people.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The exhibit continues through April 13.<br />
	&ndash; Jan. 16, 2013</p>
