Only time will tell if Dianne Harrison and California State
University, Monterey Bay are a match made in heaven. But you&apos;ve got
to like the odds. Harrison is the new president of CSUMB. She was
selected from three finalists to become the university&apos;s second
president in its 11-year history. Her job is scheduled to begin
sometime this summer. Join us in welcoming the new president and
wishing her well.<br>
