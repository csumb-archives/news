<h3>Alumna finalist for presidential award</h3>
<p>A CSU Monterey Bay graduate has been nominated for a national
teaching award.</p>
<p><img alt="Stefanie Pechan teaches at the Monterey Bay Aquarium during the summer" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/stefanie_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:450px; height:300px">Stefanie Pechan is
one of six teachers chosen as California finalists for the
Presidential Awards for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching.
The fifth-grade teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School
District was nominated in the science category.</p>
<p>In 2001, Pechan earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in liberal studies
with an emphasis in computer science and technology, and then
pursued a teaching credential at Sacramento State.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m really excited,&#x201D; she said of the nomination. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud to
represent CSUMB and Monterey County.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She has been teaching for 13 years, five of them at Robert Down
Elementary School in Pacific Grove, and is a member of the school&#x2019;s
instructional leadership team. She&#x2019;s also a member of the education
staff at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. This summer, she&#x2019;s showing
other elementary school teachers how to refine their skills at the
aquarium&#x2019;s Coastal Systems Teacher Institute.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I absolutely love teaching,&#x201D; she says on her website. &#x201C;It runs
in the family as both my mother and grandmother were teachers.&#x201D; Her
father was a microbiologist.</p>
<p>Pechan&#x2019;s teaching philosophy is based on a hands-on learning
approach. Everyone has his or her own unique way of learning, she
believes. &#x201C;It is my job as an educator to meet those needs and to
help my students reach their fullest potential.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Presidential Awards are the nation&apos;s highest honors for math
and science teachers. Awardees serve as models for their
colleagues, inspiration to their communities, and leaders in the
improvement of mathematics and science education.</p>
<p>Nominees for the state award had to submit a 45-minute video
lesson. A panel of their peers reviewed each candidate&#x2019;s content
knowledge, teaching effectiveness, achievement results and
professional involvement.</p>
<p>State finalists have been forwarded to the National Science
Foundation, which administers the awards on behalf of the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy. An NSF committee
will recommend one or two award winners from each state. They will
be invited to Washington, D.C., to attend a series of recognition
events and professional development opportunities, meet President
Obama and pick up a check for $10,000.</p>
<p>Pechan, 35, said her students are excited about the possibility
of their teacher winning national recognition. &#x201C;I promised them
that if I win, we will go to Miyo to get yogurt and celebrate,&#x201D; she
told the Monterey Herald.</p>
