<h3>CSUMB&#x2019;s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute&#xA0;brings<br>
50-and-better folks back to school</h3>
<p>What do banned books, native plants and Monet&#x2019;s garden have in
common?</p>
<p><img alt="OLLI catalogue" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/olli_f11_350.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:453px">They are among the
classes that will be offered this semester through the Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI &#x2013; at California State
University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>OLLI resumes this fall for its fifth year with a diverse range
of courses and speakers specifically for those 50 and better.</p>
<p>OLLI at CSU Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher
Foundation, is part of a national network that recognizes learning
and exploration have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a
fresh look at themselves, their world, and the possibilities that
await them &#x2013; without the stress of papers, exams or grades.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are a variety of writing classes;
Femmes Fatales: The Dark Ladies of Film Noir; Modern Spiritual
Masters with popular instructor John Provost; New Perspectives on
California Mission History; California Native Plants; dance history
with Fran Spector Atkins; Developing the Photographic Portfolio
taught by Barbara Moon Batista and Fernando Batista; and Winter
Wildlife at Jacks Peak Park.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a four-session
class on California&#x2019;s New Political Order that will take a look at
redistricting, open primaries and majority-vote budget. And the
popular CSUMB Gospel Choir class, taught by Professor Paulette
Gissendanner, will be offered on Tuesday afternoons for 16
weeks.</p>
<p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can
sign up for an annual membership &#x2013; which includes tuition for six
classes for $180 &#x2013; or a semester&#x2019;s membership for $120 for three
classes. Memberships include a campus parking pass and other
benefits.</p>
