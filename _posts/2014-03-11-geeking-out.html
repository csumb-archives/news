<h3>Students, professors put pie in Pi Day</h3>
<p><img alt="Pi" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/pi_day_for_web.png" style="float:left; width:200px; height:195px">It&apos;s not likely
anyone is getting the day off from school or work for it, but
National Pi Day is Friday.<br>
<br>
Since 1988, when the first celebration was held at the San
Francisco Exploratorium, the day has been commemorated around the
world.<br>
<br>
Pi Day is celebrated on the 14th day of the third month, which
aligns with the first three digits of pi &#x2013; 3.14 &#x2013; the ratio of a
circle&apos;s circumference to its diameter.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is celebrating a day early this year. Since
spring break is next week, many students will leave campus on
Friday.</p>
<p class="pullquote">Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day in
1879&#xA0;</p>
<p>To celebrate what Math and Statistics Club president Lauren
Sommers calls &#x201C;the fantastic transcendental number pi,&#x201D; the club
will offer free pie, a pie-eating contest and the opportunity to
&#x201C;pie&#x201D; a faculty member and a club officer. They will be chosen
based on the total amount of donations placed in jars in the math
office (Room S216 in the Chapman Building).</p>
<p>The fun will take place between 1 and 3 p.m. Thursday at the
back of the Chapman Science Academic Building. Everyone is
invited.<br>
<br>
<em>Did you know?</em></p>
<p><em>&#x2022; The earliest record of pi is on the Rhind Papyrus and is
only 1 percent off today&apos;s calculation</em></p>
<p><em>&#x2022; Pi has been studied by humans for almost 4,000
years</em></p>
