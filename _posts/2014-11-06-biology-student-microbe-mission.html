senior biology major, is on a microbe mission.<br>
<br>
Valdez, in conjunction with Dr. Gretchen Hofmann&#x2019;s lab at UC Santa
Barbara, is studying a wasting disease contributing to the recent
demise of sea stars, a keystone species in the near-shore
environment.<br>
<br>
Valdez is using molecular techniques to determine the diversity of
bacterial organisms found on sea stars with wasting disease, and
comparing them to bacterial populations on healthy sea stars.</p>

comprises much of the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Graduate
Research Fellowship Program application that Valdez is writing this
semester, will contribute to a greater understanding of this
complex disease.<br>
<br>
Valdez began the study in Hofmann&#x2019;s lab last summer, and continues
it this semester in the campus lab of <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/staff/aparna/aparna/Welcome.html" rel="nofollow">Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan</a>. She is funded in part by the
<a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu/lsamp" rel="nofollow">Louis Stokes
Alliance for Minority Participation</a> and CSUMB&#x2019;s <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Center</a>, and hopes to present this project at
regional and national conferences this year.<br>
<br>
She has also found time to serve other students in a variety of
ways. She&#x2019;s an officer in the university&#x2019;s chapter of Beta Beta
Beta, the national biological honor society; helps other students
through the Peer-to-Peer Mentor program; works as a teaching
assistant for molecular biology and organic chemistry courses; and
co-directed last semester&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Week events.</p>
<p>Valdez is one of three CSUMB students featured in a new
publication from the CSU.<br>
<a href="http://www.csus.edu/csu-lsamp/" rel="nofollow">The
California State University Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation</a>&#xA0;program has published its first &#x201C;Program
Recognizing Outstanding Undergraduate Distinction&#x201D; or PROUD, an
online look at outstanding students throughout the system&#x2019;s 23
campuses.</p>
