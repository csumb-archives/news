La Cultura Cura - The culture cures. Amalia Mesa-Bains used that
simple mantra as her strength, her personal miracle, while
recovering from severe injuries suffered in a 2003 car wreck. In
her case, la cultura wasn&apos;t just the cure, it propelled the healing
process. &quot;I do believe that healing is not necessarily a physical
process,&quot; said Mesa-Bains, a professor at CSU-Monterey Bay. &quot;It&apos;s a
process that involves family, spirituality . . . and
cultura.&quot;<br>
