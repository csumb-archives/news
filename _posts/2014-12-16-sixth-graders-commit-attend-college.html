before they even graduate from high school, but hundreds of
sixth-grade students are already planning for college, thanks to a
program at CSU Monterey Bay.&#x2028;<br>
<br>
On Dec. 10, more than 500 youngsters from seven schools in the
Salinas City Elementary School District visited campus. They
promised to do their best in school, work hard, graduate from high
school and pursue a college degree as part of the University
Promise of CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>&#x2028;&#x2028;In return, Interim Coordinator of TRiO Student Support
Services Omar Murillo promised that the university will save a spot
for them if they complete high school and meet other basic
requirements. As part of the promise, the university will work with
the students and their parents to help arrange financial
aid.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to ask you to make a promise, a promise about your
future,&#x201D; he told the youngsters assembled in the University Center
ballroom. &#x201C;And we call it the University Promise of CSU Monterey
Bay.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Each and every one of you has the opportunity to get a college
degree . . . we&#x2019;re promising you we will help you and we will save
a place for you, but it also takes a promise from you,&#x201D; Murillo
told the youngsters.<br>

received a packet containing a poster that explains what they need
to do to prepare for college on a year-by-year basis starting in
the sixth grade; a certificate for them to sign acknowledging their
promise to prepare for and attend college; information on the
outreach and support programs available at CSUMB; and a letter to
their parents explaining the event and asking them to frame and
display the certificate.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;And they received a Junior Otter card, with a space for their
signature. The card reminds the students of their promise.</p>
<p>&#x2028;&#x2028;University students led the youngsters on a tour of campus,
visiting the science building, the library and the student
center.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Over five days ending Dec. 10, approximately 2,000 youngsters from
Alisal Union, Gonzales Unified and Salinas City Elementary school
districts visited CSUMB. Since the program began in the spring of
2009, more than 12,000 Monterey County sixth-graders have visited
campus.&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
The program was developed by CSUMB officials as a way to help
youngsters recognize opportunities, make choices that they may not
have known existed for them, and keep them motivated for
success.<br>
