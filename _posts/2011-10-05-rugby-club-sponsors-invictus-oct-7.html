<p>The Rugby Club at CSU Monterey Bay invites the community to
attend a free screening of the Oscar-nominated film &#x201C;Invictus&#x201D; on
Oct. 7.</p>
<p><img alt="Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela in &apos;Invictus&apos;" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/morganfmandela.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:233px">The film will be
shown at 6 p.m. in Room 1188 of the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family
Memorial Library. Driving directions and a campus map are available
<a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Directed by Clint Eastwood, &#x201C;Invictus&#x201D; tells the story of how
South African President Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman)
joined forces with the captain of South Africa&apos;s rugby team,
Francois Plenaar (Matt Damon) to help unite the country. South
Africa was still economically and racially divided in the aftermath
of apartheid when the team won the 1995 Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p>The showing is timed to coincide with the Rugby World Cup being
contested through Oct. 23 in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Rugby Club, along with the Otter Student Union, decided to
sponsor this film because it shows the place of sports in ethical,
social and political struggles,&#x201D; said club president Ryan
Scott.</p>
<p>To reach Room 1188, attendees must use the back entrance to the
library. The film is free, but visitors must purchase a parking
permit from dispensers located on the parking lot adjacent to the
library.</p>
