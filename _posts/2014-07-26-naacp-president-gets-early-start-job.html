<p>When she was elected in the spring of 2014 to head the campus
chapter of the NAACP, Mia Elliott said, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait to start. I
am really looking forward to being president.&#x201D;</p>

Studies major from Sacramento, Elliott will take over in the fall &#x2013;
when the chapter celebrates its third year of existence.</p>
<p>She&apos;s getting a head start on the position, attending the civil
rights organization&apos;s annual convention July 19-23 in Las
Vegas.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s overwhelming, in the best way possible,&quot; Elliott said via
e-mail. &quot;I&apos;m learning so much, and I&apos;m surrounded by great and
powerful leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the things she&apos;s learned about is the Voting Rights Act,
and how important it is for college students to vote in this year&apos;s
midterm elections.</p>
<p>She&apos;s also realized that the civil rights organization is not
irrelevant, as some people have said. &quot;I have learned that in
today&apos;s society, we need the NAACP. It will continue to be relevant
until we have equal rights for ALL people.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time of her election, Elliott said she &quot;wanted to be
president because I have a passion for social justice and social
change. I want to use my leadership skills and experience to make a
difference on campus,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Her immediate goals are to increase the chapter&#x2019;s membership and
to &#x201C;have the NAACP be an inclusive, diverse club open to all people
of color and all our allies.</p>

like students to know that we are an ally for all students of color
and will be a support system when needed,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Elliott added that she would like to collaborate with other
social change/justice groups on campus to educate students on civil
rights issues.</p>
<p>The campus chapter was chartered in July of 2012 and held its
first meeting in September of that year. Shiyla Goodie served as
president the first two years.</p>
<p>Under her leadership, the group worked to register voters before
the 2012 presidential election; educated students on the importance
of voting; connected with cultural clubs and organizations on
campus to promote civil rights; and organized service projects in
the community.</p>
