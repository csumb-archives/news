Seaside High School and the Boys and Girls Clubs, helping them
recruit volunteers and better achieve their mission.</p>
<p>They are the 12 AmeriCorps VIPs who are based at CSUMB&#x2019;s Service
Learning Institute.<br>
<br>
As part of national AmeriCorps Week, their work will be showcased
at the Student Center West Lounge on March 14.<br>
<br>
From 6 to 7:30 p.m., visitors will have an opportunity to meet the
VIPs and learn about the community organizations they serve.<br>
<br>
The week, celebrated March 8 to 14, is a time to salute the
national service provided by AmeriCorps members and alumni across
the nation, thank their community partners, and communicate the
impact that AmeriCorps has on communities and on the lives of the
members who serve.<br>
<br>
In 2010, <a href="http://www.calserves.org/index.php/programs/vip" rel="nofollow">CalServes</a> launched a new AmeriCorps program
called the Volunteer Infrastructure Project &#x2013; VIP &#x2013; and CSUMB&#x2019;s
Service Learning Institute became one of 14 supervising agencies in
the state. Laura Lee Lienk , CSUMB professor and director of the
Return of the Natives restoration education project, coordinates
the program.<br>
<br>
VIP Fellows work behind the scenes of service, recruiting
volunteers and ensuring that the community&#x2019;s needs are met.</p>
<p>Last year, the university&#x2019;s VIPs recruited 5,400 volunteers who
contributed 41,287 hours of service to local communities. <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/americorps-vip-members" rel="nofollow">Read about the 2012-13 class of CSUMB AmeriCorps
VIPs.</a><br>
<br>
In addition to CSUMB&#x2019;s 10 VIP Fellows, two VIP Leaders are working
on campus &#x2013; Zac Walker and Steven Goings.</p>
<p>Walker is the program specialist for the <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/about" rel="nofollow">Service Learning
Student Leader Program,</a> which employs students with prior
service learning experience in leadership roles to help inimplement
CSUMB&#x2019;s service learning mission.<br>
<br>
Goings serves as a liaison between the Service Learning Institute
and Student Affairs and runs the <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/purposeful-service-opportunities" rel="nofollow">Purposeful Service Opportunities Program</a> that
provides volunteer opportunities for CSUMB students and student
organizations.<br>
<br>
This semester, Purposeful Service Opportunities launched the
<a href="http://service.csumb.edu/king-chavez-semester-service-challenge" rel="nofollow">King/Chavez Semester of Service Challenge,</a> a
friendly competition between CSUMB student organizations to earn
points by documenting their service. Students who attend the
various AmeriCorps Week activities earn double points for the
contest. See the full schedule of events <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/americorps-week" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p>Nationally, AmeriCorps is known as the domestic Peace Corps and
provides a huge array of services to those in need. The AmeriCorps
VIP Project is designed to address the significant challenges faced
by California communities due to the recent economic
downturn.<br>
<br>
AmeriCorps is not a job, it&#x2019;s a paid service experience. All
positions are full time and last 10 or 11 months; all pay&#xA0;a
living allowance and an educational award upon completion. Students
interested in joining AmeriCorps after graduation can learn more
