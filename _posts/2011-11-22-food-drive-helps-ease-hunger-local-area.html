<p>With help from the local community, CSU Monterey Bay collected
more than 2,500 lbs. of food to help those in need this holiday
season.</p>
<p><img alt="The December People inspired people to donate 1,500 lbs. of food" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/december_people-sm_food.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:261px">To earn a big
discount off the ticket price for the Nov. 12 performances of the
December People, those who attended the World Theater concerts were
asked to bring cans of food for people and pets.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The drive was a collaboration between the World Theater and
radio station HIPPO 104.3 FM.&#xA0;The donations &#x2013; three-quarters
of a ton &#x2013; were given to the food banks of Monterey and San Benito
counties and local animal shelters.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
This was the second year the group appeared at CSUMB. &#x201C;Because of
the fantastic audience response last year and the success of the
food drive we launched, we brought December People back. The
audiences were enthusiastic, and the food drive was a success once
again,&#x201D; said Joe Cardinalli, director of the World Theater.</p>
<p>The December People &#x2013; Robert Berry, Gary Pihl, Dave Medd, Mike
Vanderhule and Jack Foster &#x2013; have been dubbed a &#x201C;Christian
contemporary Spinal Tap.&#x201D; The group puts its own take on yuletide
classics &#x2013; think Led Zeppelin doing &#x201C;Silent Night&#x201D; or a Latin-fused
Santana variation of &#x201C;Deck the Halls.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, students, faculty and staff, with sponsorship by
Sodexo, contributed 1,040 lbs. of food to the Helping Hands Food
Drive. It went to the Food Bank of Monterey County in time for
Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
The drive is an annual event on campus. Students donate meal plan
blocks, which Campus Dining converts into bulk food items such as
bags of rice, cake and brownie mix, canned milk and vegetables.
More than $1,500 in meal plan blocks was contributed by
students.</p>
<p>Avocet Hall was the winner of this year&apos;s competition among
residence halls to see which could donate the most food at the
annual Harvest Dinner.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Hunger remains a persistent reality in the area. According to
the report &#x201C;Hunger in America 2010,&#x201D; an estimated 88,700 different
people are served annually by the Food Bank for Monterey County &#x2013;
one-fifth of Monterey County&#x2019;s population. Every week it serves
approximately 10,800 people.</p>
