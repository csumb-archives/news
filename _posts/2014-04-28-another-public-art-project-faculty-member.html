<p><a href="http://vpa.csumb.edu/people/johanna-poethig" rel="nofollow">Johanna Poethig</a>, who has worked on dozens of
large-scale murals and other art installations around the country,
has taken on yet another project.</p>
<p>Poethig, a professor in CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s <a href="http://vpa.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Visual and Public Art
Department,</a> has been named lead artist on a transportation
project in the East Bay area of San Francisco.</p>
<p>She and <a href="../../../2012/oct/11/art-social-change.html" rel="nofollow">Mildred Howard</a>, another artist from the
Berkeley-Oakland area, will work to integrate art into the
architecture of 34 planned stations on the 9.5-mile East Bay Bus
Rapid Transit route that will run from Oakland to the San Leandro
BART station. Also on the team are artists Joyce Hsu and Peter
Richards.</p>
<p>A panel of art professionals, government and community
representatives chose the artists after a national search. The team
will integrate works into the stations around a central theme of
&#x201C;Honor the Past and Celebrate the Future.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Poethig&#x2019;s Bay Area work includes a mural in downtown San
Francisco for the International Hotel in Manilatown, a ceramic tile
installation at the 149 Mason Street Studios, and medallions for
the Hamilton Recreation Center.</p>
<p>Born in New Jersey and raised in Manila, Philippines, Poethig
earned degrees from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and
Mills College. She&#x2019;s been in California since 1976, forging an
eclectic career from a variety of interests and mediums, from
painting and sculpture to performance art and video.<br>
