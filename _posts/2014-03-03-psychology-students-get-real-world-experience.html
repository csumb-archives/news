<h3>Kinship Center collaborates with CSUMB</h3>
<p>Cal State Monterey Bay faculty member Kathryn England-Aytes
believes in the power of real-world experience.<br>
<br>
As a lecturer in psychology, she works to give her students a
chance to learn first-hand from professionals.<br>
<br>
This semester, students in her clinical psychology course are
getting that opportunity thanks to a collaboration with the Kinship
Center, a nonprofit that provides mental health and counseling
services to children and families touched by adoption, foster care,
relative caregiving or legal guardianship.<br>
<br>
Professionals at the Kinship Center are providing students with a
look at the field of child welfare and mental health. Using
clinical theory, hands-on activities and lectures at the center&#x2019;s
Salinas campus, the course brings real-life applications to
students considering careers in the mental health field.<br>
<br>
The Kinship Center, a member of the Seneca Family of Agencies, has
been honored nationally for its life-changing outcomes for more
than 2,500 children each year through therapeutic foster care,
kinship (relative) care, mental health services for children and
families, intensive support for families in crisis, prevention
programs to keep children out of child welfare, adoption and
education and training for parents and professionals.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re excited about this collaboration,&#x201D; Professor England-Aytes
said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s already connecting students with the community in ways
that make us proud.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kinship staff members will deliver six lectures during the course
of the semester, covering topics including cultural issues, child
trauma, behavioral psychotherapy, group and family therapy and
working with children and adolescents.<br>
<br>
After two lectures, students are clearly enthusiastic. Student
evaluations have included these comments:</p>
<p>&#x2028;&#x2022; &#x201C;This experience has helped me choose my area of future
study.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x2022; &#x201C;Great information from first-hand accounts.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x2022; &#x201C;The lectures get me thinking about what I really want to do with
my education.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Kinship co-founder Carol Biddle said she is &#x201C;delighted&#x201D; to partner
with the university to give students a better understanding of the
practical applications of their educational program. She noted that
the center has hired a number of CSUMB psychology graduates over
the years.<br>
<br>
The center has also provided placements for students in CSUMB&#x2019;s
master&#x2019;s program in social work, including two former students of
England-Aytes.</p>
<p>&quot;Being able to share our remarkable psychology students with the
mental health care community before they are seeking career
positions is helpful for them; Kinship Center makes it truly
meaningful,&quot; Professor England-Aytes said.<br>
