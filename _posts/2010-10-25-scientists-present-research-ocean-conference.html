Two CSUMB scientists made presentations at the California and the
World Ocean Conference Sept. 7-10 in San Francisco.
<p>The conference focused on management, policy, assessment and
communication regarding marine and ocean issues. It was organized
by California&apos;s Ocean Protection Council, Natural Resources Agency
and Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Underscoring the role strong science plays in developing sound
policy and informed management, the panels included 40 researchers
from 18 universities. Among them were CSUMB professors James
Lindholm and Rikk Kvitek.<br>
<br>
Dr. Lindholm, Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine Science and
Policy at CSUMB, was part of a session that addressed management
plans for overfished populations and how to assess the indirect
impacts of various fishing practices.</p>
<p>Dr. Kvitek, director of the university&apos;s Seafloor Mapping Lab,
made a presentation on California&apos;s seafloor mapping program as a
model for collaboration and partnership.</p>
