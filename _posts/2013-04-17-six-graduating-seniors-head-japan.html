<p>Six students who are about to graduate with a bachelor of arts
degree from CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s <a href="http://csumb.edu/Japanese" rel="nofollow">Japanese Language and Culture program</a> will head
to Japan this summer to work in the prestigious JET
program.&#xA0;</p>
<p class="pullquote">&apos;I get to live out my dream of working in
Japan.&apos;<br>
&#x2013; Salvador Nava</p>
<p>JET &#x2013; the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program &#x2013; hires students
from 45 countries to provide language instruction to primary,
middle and high school students and to work in local government
offices. They translate and interpret for foreign officials and
visitors and work on sister-city relations. The goal is to promote
mutual understanding between Japan and other nations.</p>
<p>Run by that country&apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the JET
program is highly competitive, especially in Central and Northern
California.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&apos;I can&apos;t wait to be an ambassador for the
United States, and for CSUMB as well.&apos;<br>
&#x2013; Chelsea Nagy</p>
<p>&#x201C;According to a JET representative, only 33 percent of
applicants get selected,&#x201D; said Dr. Shigeko Sekine, associate
professor in the School of World Languages and Cultures.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the Japanese Language and Culture program at CSUMB, we are
fortunate to be able to send 66 percent or more of our applicants
to the JET program every year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Their assignments will start in August. Their contracts are for
one year, but can be renewed for up to five years.</p>
<p>Heading to Japan are Andrew Alviar, Adam Chantri, Chelsea
Nagy,&#xA0;Ryan Kirkland, Salvador Nava and Chelsea Swick.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese National Honor Society has recognized
11 graduating seniors for outstanding achievement at the
post-secondary level of Japanese studies.</p>
<p>They are: Alviar, Aleia Ando, Rose Buchberg, Chantri, Brian
Gonzalez, Hannah Lozier, Nagy, Nava, Swick, Kristin Szabo and
Yumiko Williams.</p>
