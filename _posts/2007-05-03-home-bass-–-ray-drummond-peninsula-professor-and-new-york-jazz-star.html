Ray Drummond isn&apos;t trying to keep a low Peninsula profile on
purpose. And yet plenty of locals might be unaware that one of the
world&apos;s greatest jazz bassists walks among them. For the past five
years he&apos;s been an assistant professor of music at CSUMB, teaching
theory, composition and improvisation. The reason he isn&apos;t more
visible around the region is that he&apos;s racking up frequent-flyer
miles as a bi-coastal commuter. Most weeks, he spends Tuesday
through Thursday on campus and then jumps on a red-eye back to New
York, where he&apos;s a fixture in the city&apos;s major clubs and concert
halls.<br>
