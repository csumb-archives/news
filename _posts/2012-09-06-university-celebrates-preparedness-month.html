<p>CSU Monterey Bay will host two events for community members to
mark National Preparedness Month, an annual campaign that
encourages people to prepare their families, schools, businesses
and communities to deal with disasters.</p>
<p><img alt="September is National Preparedness Month" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/pledge_square.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:250px">This represents the
ninth year the Federal Emergency Management Agency has observed
NPM. This year&#x2019;s theme is Resolve to be Ready.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSUMB wants to help everyone be better prepared for the
emergencies that will inevitably impact our area,&#x201D; said Dick Bower,
the university&#x2019;s emergency manager. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re working closely with our
neighbors in Seaside, Marina and Monterey County to bring emergency
preparedness to a high level in our area. We invite community
members to join us.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An emergency preparedness fair will take place from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m., Sept. 14, on the campus quad. Information booths will be
staffed by emergency management organizations. Demonstrations will
cover disaster and medical triage, how to use a fire extinguisher,
and use of search dogs. Presentations will cover public health
threats, individual and neighborhood preparedness and volunteer
opportunities. Emergency vehicles will be on display.</p>
<p>Among the participating organizations are Presidio of Monterey
Fire Department and emergency management office; Seaside fire and
police departments; Monterey County&#x2019;s Office of Emergency Services
and Health Department; National Weather Service; and the American
Red Cross.</p>
<p>CSUMB will kick off creation of its federally registered
Community Emergency Response Team &#x2013; CERT &#x2013; with a training course
Sept. 28-30 in the university&#x2019;s Emergency Operations Center.</p>
<p>The CERT program trains community members to assist each other
and first responders in emergencies. Subjects covered include
disaster preparedness, fire safety, disaster medical operations,
light search and rescue, disaster psychology and the CERT role in
terrorism response. At the end of the training, a simulation will
be held on campus.</p>
<p>To register for the CERT training or for more information,
contact Bower at 582-3589.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Campus visitors
must purchase a parking pass from machines located on the parking
lots.</p>
