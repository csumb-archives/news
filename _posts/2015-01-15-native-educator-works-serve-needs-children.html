<p>Kathryn England-Aytes, a lecturer in psychology, has joined a
newly created national organization that serves the needs of
children.</p>
<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kathrym_head_shot.jpg" style="width:250px; height:355px; float:left"><a href="http://sbgs.csumb.edu/faculty/kathryn-england-aytes" rel="nofollow">Dr. England-Aytes</a> will serve as a consultant with
the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, an organization
that provides information, resources and services relating to
adoption, foster care and child welfare.</p>
<p>Former Kinship Center CEO Carol Biddle is the managing director;
Adam Pertman, former president of the Donaldson Adoption Institute,
is the founder and president.</p>
<p>Her work with the center &#x201C;fits into my own research interests on
historical trauma and links with contemporary behavior,
particularly in educational settings, in Indian Country,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe this will also be a good fit with my work with the
Native American Children&#x2019;s Alliance (NACA), an inter-tribal
nonprofit that works on child abuse prevention and
intervention.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As a board member and trainer for NACA, she has given
presentations on child forensic interviewing and cultural awareness
in multidisciplinary team settings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As a Native educator, my goal is always to honor and integrate
the cultures, values and traditions of Native students with
learning opportunities for full participation in the larger
community,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>In December, Dr. England-Aytes made a presentation at the
National Indian Nations Conference: Justice for Victims of Crime,
held on the Agua Caliente reservation in Southern California. Along
with co-presenters from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the South
Dakota Highway Patrol and the National Children&#x2019;s Alliance, she
talked on &#x201C;Building Resiliency in Child Abuse Organizations Working
with Native Children.&#x201D;</p>

continue to be published about the book &#x201C;Teaching Truly: A
Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education&#x201D; by Four Arrows, to
which Dr. England-Aytes contributed a chapter.</p>
<p>According to a review in Education Review/Rese&#xF1;as Educativas,
her chapter on historical trauma and its prevention in the
classroom established the first and most critical part of the
book.<br>
