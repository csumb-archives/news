Though workers noisily pound through asphalt and raucously tear
down worn-out buildings, the California State University, Monterey
Bay campus is undergoing a quiet transformation. Piece by piece,

becoming brand new. Work began last week on an $80 million,
two-year wave of construction that will lay the foundation for a
massive campus overhaul to be completd over the next two
decades.<br>
