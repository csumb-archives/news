<h3>Photographer, global health researcher to give
presentations</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay alumnus Daniel Jack Lyons will visit campus
Nov. 18 and 19 for a pair of presentations on his current work.</p>
<p>Lyons, a 2004 graduate with a degree in Social and Behavioral
Sciences, earned a master&#x2019;s degree in public health from Columbia
University before launching a career as a photographer and global
health research consultant.</p>
<p>In his human rights and public health work, he employs a
technique called photovoice, which combines photography with
grassroots social action. Participants in his projects are asked to
represent their community or point of view by taking photos,
discussing them as a group and then developing narratives to go
with the photos. The projects provide insight into how people
experience human rights abuses and public health issues and help
them understand their circumstances and define their hopes for the
future.</p>
<p>On his website, Lyons explained that he also uses photographs
and reporting to document the process as well as the lives of
participants in his work.<br>

held positions and consulted as a researcher for the Foundation for
AIDS Research, Columbia University, the United Nations, PCI Media
Impact and Vanderbilt University. His work has been published on

Culture, Health and Sexuality. He lives in New York City.</p>
