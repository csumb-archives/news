<h3>Cult figure to screen his newest film</h3>
<p>Stick figures have never looked as good as they do in Don
Hertzfeldt&#x2019;s films.</p>
<p><img alt="Hertzfeldt at work" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/hertzfeldt_at_animation_desk.jpg" style="float:left; width:320px; height:240px">While most
animators have tossed aside their pencils in favor of computers,
the Oscar-nominated filmmaker still works by hand.</p>
<p>The public will get an opportunity to see Hertzfeldt&#x2019;s work when
he visits CSU Monterey Bay for two presentations on Jan. 30.</p>
<p>The free programs will start at 2 and 6 p.m. in the Teledramatic
Arts and Technology Studio on Sixth Avenue. Both are open to the
public.</p>
<p>The program will include a collection of Hertzfeldt&#x2019;s short
films as well as the regional premiere of his newest film, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
Such a Beautiful Day,&#x201D; the third and final chapter in a trilogy
about a mysterious man named Bill. The film was chosen for this
year&#x2019;s Sundance Film Festival.<br>
<br>
A question-and-answer session will follow.</p>
<p>Nearly two years in the making, the 23-minute &#x201C;It&apos;s Such a
Beautiful Day&#x201D; is his longest, and most ambitious, piece to date.
It blends traditional animation, experimental optical effects,
trick photography and new digital hybrids printed out one frame at
a time.</p>
<p>Among the cult animator&#x2019;s best-known films are &#x201C;Rejected,&#x201D;
&#x201C;Everything will be OK,&#x201D; and &#x201C;I am so Proud of You.&#x201D;<br>

Hertzfeldt has remained fiercely independent by sticking to short
format and challenging the boundaries of his craft. The work is
enormously popular; his films are frequently referenced in pop
culture.</p>
<p>Created with pen and paper and without the aid of computers, his
work commonly features hand-drawn stick figures in odd stories
infused with black humor, surrealism and tragicomedy.</p>
<p>Hertzfeldt&apos;s animated films have been featured in over a
thousand film festivals around the world and have received over 150
awards including a Short Film Palm D&apos;or nomination at the 1999
Cannes Film Festival, a 2001 Oscar nomination for Best Animated
Short and the Sundance Film Festival&apos;s Jury Award in Short
Filmmaking. His work is also featured on television, including MTV,
Bravo and IFC.</p>
<p>In 2010, Hertzfeldt received the San Francisco International
Film Festival&apos;s &quot;Persistence of Vision&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award
at the age of 33.</p>
<p>The event is co-sponsored by the Monterey Bay Film Society, and
is supported by the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, in
partnership with the Monterey County Office of Education.</p>
