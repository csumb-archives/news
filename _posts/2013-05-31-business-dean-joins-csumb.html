<p>CSU Monterey Bay President Eduardo Ochoa has named Shyam Kamath
dean of the university&#x2019;s College of Business Administration.</p>

leadership of the newly created college on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am delighted to join CSUMB as the founding dean of the new
College of Business. I look forward to building on the excellent
foundations created by those who have established an outstanding
school of business in the past two decades since CSUMB was
established,&#x201D; Dr. Kamath said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My decision to join CSUMB was based on its excellent
reputation, outstanding faculty, staff and student body and the
tremendous potential to build an regionally, nationally and
internationally recognized College of Business.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said President Ochoa: &#x201C;We are excited that Dr. Kamath has agreed
to become the founding dean of our College of Business. He is a
strong leader with an outstanding range of experience in both the
private sector and academia. His international background will be a
great asset as we develop a College of Business that educates
students with a global perspective.&#x201D;</p>
<p>President Ochoa said that the creation of a College of Business
will allow enrollment to continue to grow; business is already the
top undergraduate major at CSUMB. The university plans to enhance
its academic programs that respond to regional needs, in areas such
as hospitality management and agricultural business, and eventually
seek accreditation through the Association to Advance Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB).<br>
<br>
Dr. Kamath has more than 35 years of experience in international
education, international development and management, sustainable
enterprise formation, global business consulting and university
teaching.</p>
<p>He comes to CSUMB from St. Mary&#x2019;s College in Moraga, where he is
a professor of global business and economics and associate dean of
graduate business and global programs in the School of Economics
and Business Administration. As director of St. Mary&#x2019;s Trans-Global
Executive program, he teaches graduate students to apply business
solutions to social service needs in order to help people at the
bottom of the economic pyramid</p>
<p>Prior to his stint there, he spent more than two decades as a
professor of international economics and business at CSU East Bay
and started the university&#x2019;s Transnational Executive MBA
program.</p>
<p>He previously taught at Dalhlousie and Simon Fraser universities
in Canada and the University of Madras in India.</p>
<p>He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in economics from the University
of Delhi, a master of business administration degree from the
Indian Institute of Management, and a master&#x2019;s and Ph.D. in
economics from Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>He has served as a consultant to more than 100 firms,
non-governmental organizations and nonprofits in 15 countries on
four continents, and has been an economic consultant to the
governments of Austria, Brazil, China, Indian and Thailand, to the
United Nations Development Program, and numerous private
foundations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I look forward to the opportunity to work with the faculty,
staff, students and the administration to build new programs, hire
new faculty and staff, initiate the accreditation process and grow
the college to meet the challenges of the 21st century,&#x201D; Dr. Kamath
said.</p>
<p>Business classes have been offered at CSUMB since the founding
of the university. The program has grown steadily and is now the
largest program on campus, enrolling about 14 percent &#x2013; 640
students &#x2013; of undergraduates. Those students can choose to
concentrate in accounting, agribusiness, entrepreneurship,
hospitality and hotel/resort management, information technology and
e-commerce, management and international business and
marketing.</p>
<p>In addition, traditional and executive MBA programs are
available online; approximately 200 students are currently
enrolled.<br>
<br>
Next year, the university expects to break ground on a building
that will house the College of Business and the School of
Information Technology and Communications Design.<br>
