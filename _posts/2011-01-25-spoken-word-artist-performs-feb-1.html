<h2>GRAND SLAM</h2>
<h3>Saul Williams kicks off Black History Month at CSUMB</h3>
<p>In celebration of Black History Month, spoken-word artist Saul
Williams will perform at CSU Monterey at 7 p.m., Feb. 1, in the
University Center ballroom.</p>
<p><img alt="Saul Williams" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/williams_saul3001.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:199px">Williams has been
called a &#x201C;new-age hip-hop renaissance man&#x201D; by the Fresno Bee.
Esquire magazine called him the &#x201C;Bob Marley of American poets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s a slam poet, author, actor and a musician who raps and
plays guitar. To young people across the country, he has defined
poetry as an accessible, living art form; many view him as the
catalyst for the spoken word movement and the advent of poetry
slams.</p>
<p>After graduating from Morehouse College with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree
in acting and philosophy, Williams moved to New York City to earn a
master&apos;s degree in acting at New York University. There, he found
himself at the center of the New York cafe poetry scene.</p>
<p>He landed the lead role in the 1998 film Slam. Williams served
as both a writer and actor on the film, which won the Sundance
Festival Grand Jury Prize and the Camera D&apos;Or prize at Cannes and
introduced him to international audiences.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s written three collections of poetry and has been published
in the New York Times, Esquire and African Voices. His newest book,
&#x201C;The Dead Emcee Scrolls: The Lost Teachings of Hip-Hop,&#x201D; recounts
the history of that genre. As a poet and musician, Williams has
toured and lectured around the world, appearing at many
universities and colleges.</p>
<p>Admission is $5 and tickets can be purchased at the door. A $2
parking pass must be purchased as well. Driving directions and a
campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.</p>

<p>The concert is sponsored by the Associated Students and the
Office of Student Activities and Leadership Development.</p>
