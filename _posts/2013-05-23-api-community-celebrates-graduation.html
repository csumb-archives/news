<p>Patti Hiramoto, vice president of University Advancement,
reminded the gathering at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s first Asian Pacific
Islander American community graduation celebration about the
importance of community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The API community can be an anchor, a place to return to, when
life gets difficult and when life&#x2019;s joys are to be shared,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
<p>The event, held the day before commencement, marked an important
milestone for the university&#x2019;s Asian Pacific Islander community and
the 21 students who participated. It celebrated their achievements
and the people who helped them along the way.</p>
<p>The plan is to make it an annual event.</p>
<p>Although Asian Pacific Islander American students make up only 6
percent of the student population at CSUMB, it is a growing group
with students dedicated to building a stronger, more vibrant
community on campus.<br>
<br>
They have organized a variety of events &#x2013; cultural dances, social
gatherings and performances &#x2013; to connect with other students,
educate others on their heritage and celebrate their
achievements.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in participating in next year&apos;s Asian Pacific
Islander graduation celebration or being part of the planning
committee can contact Jihan Ejan at <a href="mailto:jejan@csumb.edu">jejan@csumb.edu</a>.</p>
