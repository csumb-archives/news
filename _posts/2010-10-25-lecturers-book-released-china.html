<p>The first university textbook on human sexuality to be published
in China was co-authored by a CSU Monterey Bay faculty
member.&#xA0;</p>
<p>After the seventh edition of&#xA0; &#x201C;Human Sexuality: Diversity
in Contemporary America&#x201D; by Barbara Sayad of CSUMB and Bill Yarber
of Indiana University and the Kinsey Institute was published
recently, the authors were approached about the possibility of
having it translated into Chinese.</p>
<p>Several issues surfaced immediately.</p>
<p>Because it&#x2019;s illegal to be gay or lesbian in China, the
government would not approve the book for use in public
universities, and cultural biases and assumptions needed to be
addressed. After numerous phone calls, e-mails and meetings, these
issues were resolved to everyone&apos;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill agreed to release the textbook as a trade
publication to circumvent censorship issues. The Chinese professors
who served as volunteer translators did their work in a way that
was culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs and concerns of
university students. And while the book won&apos;t be sold on campuses,
it is available in public bookstores.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, Dr. Sayad teaches human sexuality, women&apos;s health,
marriage and family, and wellness with a focus on service
learning.</p>
