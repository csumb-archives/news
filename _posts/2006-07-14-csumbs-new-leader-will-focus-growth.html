Since it opened its doors to 650 students in the fall of 1995,
CSUMB has transformed itself from a sleepy school facility to an
economic powerhouse, pumping more than $100 million annually into
the local community. And even bigger things lie ahead, says its new
president, Dianne Harrison, who is embarking on an ambitious
building program to handle an expected 8,000 students by early in
the next decade.<br>
