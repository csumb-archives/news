To help recognize National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week,
students at CSUMB have organized several events, including a &quot;Faces
of Homelessness&quot; panel that will deal with the roots of poverty.
The students also set up a &quot;shantytown&quot; in the main quad. The
display consists of several cardboard structures. &quot;We&apos;re trying to
raise awareness,&quot; said junior Kristen Costello. &quot;We want students
to get away from the &apos;university bubble.&apos; &quot;<br>
