animator and puppet maker, will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 10
for a pair of events open to the public.</p>
<p>Hale has more than a decade of experience making animated films,
which combine computer effects with puppetry, and has won numerous
awards for his work.</p>
<p>Perhaps his best-known work, &#x201C;Yamasong,&#x201D; has been honored at the
Atlanta Film Festival, the Graphation Film Festival in Los Angeles
and the World Music and Independent Film Festival. His other
credits include art director for the Cartoon Network show &#x201C;Annoying
Orange,&#x201D; lead VFX artist for Disney Jr.&#x2019;s &#x201C;Bite-Sized Adventures of
Sam Sandwich,&#x201D; and associate producer for Disney&#x2019;s pilot, &#x201C;Team
Smithereen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On April 10:</p>
<p>&#x2022; From 3-5 p.m., Mr. Hale will present a workshop on stop-motion
puppet making. He will discuss his fabrication and construction
process and show how he made &#x201C;Yamasong&#x201D; and his current
work-in-progress, &#x201C;Monster of the Sky.&#x201D;</p>

Mr. Hale will present the latest collection of Handmade Puppet
Dreams, a film series created by Heather Henson, daughter of the
late Jim Henson. Handmade Puppet Dreams is a touring festival of
films, created by independent artists. The films focus primarily on
marionettes, finger puppets and paper cutouts, and showcase a new
generation of puppeteers who embrace film as a medium of artistic
expression. Mr. Hale works as a producer for Handmade Puppet
Dreams.</p>
<p>Both events will be held in the Cinematic Arts Building on Sixth
Avenue and A Street. Driving directions and a campus map are
available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
While the events are free, visitors must purchase a parking permit
from a machine on the lot.</p>
<p>Some of the films contain mature content and are not suitable
for children younger than 14.</p>
<p>On April 12, the university and MY Museum will partner to offer
a program for the whole family. At 1 p.m., puppet films will be
screened, followed by puppet-making activities with Mr. Hale. The
program is free with museum admission. MY Museum is located at 425
Washington St., Monterey.</p>
<p>CSUMB is developing an animation curriculum within its <a href="http://csumb.edu/tat" rel="nofollow">Cinematic Arts and Technology
Department.</a> This is the program&#x2019;s first public event.<br>
