<h4>CSUMB students team with CCA to benefit farmworkers</h4>
<p>A billboard on display in Salinas is the result of a project
involving students in the digital mural class at California State
University, Monterey Bay and the Center for Community Advocacy.</p>
<p>Called Hands of Health, the project (which also includes a set
of postcards and a photonovela or soap opera book) demonstrates how
students&apos; work can improve community life and communicate the
issues of our region.</p>
<p>CCA&apos;s primary goal is to provide better living conditions and
health care by educating farmworkers in leadership skills so they
can help themselves and their families. The art students
collaborated with CCA&apos;s Promotores de Salud Project to promote
health among farmworkers.</p>
<p>The students met wtih labor camp leaders and residents,
interviewed workers and made several trips to labor camps in an
effort to understand CCA&apos;s role in local communities. The resulting
art pieces highlighted health issues for the farmworkers and will
help to address their need for information.</p>
<p>Through the support of the Nathan Cummings Foundation, the
promotores materials designed by the art students were provided
free of cost to the health workers for distribution.</p>
<p>The billboard, located on John Street near the intersection with
Abbott, will be formally dedicated at 1 p.m. on Dec. 12.<br></p>
