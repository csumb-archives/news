Coming to California State University, Monterey Bay, has been a
mystifying experience for plenty of visitors and residents. The
difficulty in finding one&apos;s way around campus has assumed the
proportions of an urban legend: Go to CSUMB, and you&apos;ll surely get
lost on campus, many believe. The situation has now improved. New
campus signs, maps and street name changes have gone up to get
people safely and easily through the school.<br>
