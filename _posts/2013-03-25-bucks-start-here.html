<h3>Learn how to use &#x2018;crowd funding&#x2019;</h3>
<p>In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups &#x2013; JOBS &#x2013; Act
was signed into law. It has a &#x201C;crowd funding&#x201D; amendment that
changes restrictions on how businesses can raise capital.</p>
<p>That topic will be explored at the April 8 Entrepreneurship
Forum at CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/funding_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:331px">The forum, from 4
to 6 p.m. in the World Theater, will focus on the changes in
funding opportunities for new and growing ventures created by the
JOBS Act. The act creates opportunities for fundraising on the
Internet using platforms such as Kickstarter; it also allows equity
fundraising for small companies through funding portals.</p>
<p>The event is free, but community members are asked to register
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/Crowdcsumb" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Jim White, chief executive officer of JL White International,
and Dr. Brad Barbeau of the School of Business will make
presentations.</p>
<p>Mr. White was directly involved in the JOBS Act legislation, and
is an expert on the topic. Dr. Barbeau teaches economics and
entrepreneurship, and is an expert on developing business models
for startup companies.</p>
<p>The presenters will speak on the current state of crowd funding
and the opportunities created by the JOBS Act legislation. Audience
members will have an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Dr. Brad Barbeau at 831-582-4288
or email him at <a href="mailto:bbarbeau@csumb.edu">bbarbeau@csumb.edu</a>.<br>
