<h3>Science illustration students exhibit work at P.G. Museum</h3>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve ever wondered about the artwork that illustrates
science textbooks, field guides, and&#xA0;<img alt="Tiger swallowtail butterflies" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/web_tiger_swallowtail.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:270px">interpretive signs
in parks and nature preserves, you have the opportunity to learn
about it at an exhibit in Pacific Grove.</p>
<p>Illustrating Nature, the third annual exhibit of work by
students in the CSU Monterey Bay Science Illustration Program, will
be on display at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History
through June 17. The museum is located at 165 Forest Ave., Pacific
Grove.<br>
<br>
The 63 illustrations and several field sketches in the exhibit
depict subjects ranging from tiny birds called fairy wrens to tiger
swallowtail butterflies using media including pen and ink,
scratchboard, colored pencil, watercolor, gouache, acrylic and
digital media.<br>
<br>
Several instructional workshops for adults and children will be
held in conjunction with the exhibit.</p>

science illustration program relocated from UC Santa Cruz Extension
to CSUMB. One of the most prestigious programs of its kind in the
nation, it prepares students who are sought after by scientific
institutions and publications around the world. Graduates are
working at the Smithsonian Institution; New York&#x2019;s American Museum
of Natural History; the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History; the
Monterey Bay Aquarium; and National Geographic, Scientific American
and Nature magazines.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re excited to continue a tradition of partnership with a local
natural history museum,&#x201D; said Ann Caudle, program director. &#x201C;After
a rewarding 20-year relationship with the museum in Santa Cruz, we
are happy to be collaborating with the Pacific Grove Museum of
Natural History.&#x201D;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Museum hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Admission
is free. More information about the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural
History is available <a href="http://www.pgmuseum.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

The exhibit is only one example of the partnership between CSU
Monterey Bay and the museum.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The museum has thoroughly benefited from partnering with
CSUMB,&#x201D; said museum director Lori Mannel. &#x201C;We work with the
university&#x2019;s Serving Learning Institute, have interns working with
us and support student capstone projects. Science Illustration
graduates also teach the museum&#x2019;s Drawing from the Collection
classes open to the public.&#x201D;&#x2028;<br>
