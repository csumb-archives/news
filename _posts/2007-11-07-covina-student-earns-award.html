<p>California Sea Grant has named Jasmine Ruvalcaba a 2007 John D.
Isaacs Marine Undergraduate Scholar.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funds the
Isaacs Undergraduate Research Scholars Program; California Sea
Grant selects six undergraduates who each receive $2,500 to work
with a CSG researcher.</p>
<p>Jasmine will work with Dr. Michael Graham at Moss Landing Marine
Labs, studying seaweed aquaculture.</p>
<p>The Isaacs Program was created in 2006 in memory of John Isaacs,
a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and an early
advocate of helping undergraduates further their interest and
participation in marine science. She spent her summer collecting
species of red algae, feeding young abalone, and monitoring kelp
greenlings.</p>
<p>She is a certified research diver and has worked for the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the Monterey Abalone
Company, and graduate research students from UC Santa Cruz and Moss
Landing Marine Laboratory, part of the California State University
system. Her goal is to continue developing research diving skills
at the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans
(PISCO).</p>
<p>Jasmine attended South Hills High School in West Covina and is
the daughter of Joyce Ruvalcaba and Norm Reynolds. She is scheduled
to graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay in
December and plans to attend graduate school.<br></p>
