<p><em>A woman walks alone down a dark, deserted street. With every
shadow she sees, and every sound she hears, her pounding heart
flutters and skips a beat. She hurries her pace as she sees her
destination become closer. She is almost there. She reaches the
front door, goes inside, collects herself, and moves on forgetting,
at least for tonight, the gripping fear that momentarily enveloped
her life.</em></p>
<p>This scene could have occurred anywhere last night, last year,
or even 100 years ago. Historically, women faced the anxiety of
walking alone at night and that is why Take Back the Night
began.</p>

Back the Night speak-out and march to protest sexual violence will
be held from 7 to 9 p.m., March 4 at CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>The evening will start at 7 p.m., when people will gather in the
Student Center to hear speakers and a presentation by
representatives from MyStrength, a men&#x2019;s group dedicated to ending
sexual violence. Ivy Baker, a CSUMB student, will talk about her
efforts to start a rape awareness program on campus.</p>
<p>At 8 o&#x2019;clock, candles will be lit and the group will march
through campus to symbolically reclaim the safety of the night and
raise awareness about the issue. The march will end on the quad in
front of the Student Center with a moment of silence to pay respect
to the victims and survivors of sexual violence.</p>
<p>The first Take Back the Night event in the United States took
place in Philadelphia in October of 1975. Residents of Philadelphia
rallied together after the murder of young microbiologist, Susan
Alexander Speeth, who was stabbed by a stranger a block from her
home while walking alone.</p>
<p>It has been a staple of American campus feminism since then. The
event works to empower women and serves as a collective voice to
demand an end to the violence.</p>
<p>The CSUMB event has been organized by Theta Alpha Sigma
sorority.<br>
