<p>Did you leave school before you finished your bachelor&#x2019;s degree
in computer science? Do you have a college degree but would like to
earn a second one in computer science?</p>
<p>Starting in the fall, CSU Monterey Bay will offer a degree
completion program in Computer Science and Information Technology
designed for students who have earned at least 60 college
credits.</p>
<p>The fully online program offers a blend of computer science
theory and information technology practice. Graduates will be
prepared for such job as:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Mobile app developer<br>
&#x2022; Software developer<br>
&#x2022; Project manager</p>
<p>The degree can be competed without coming to the CSUMB campus.
Online instruction is provided by a combination of university
faculty members and industry professionals. Opportunities will be
available to apply classroom content to real-world problems.</p>
<p>Applications are now being accepted; deadline is July 18 for the
fall semester.</p>
