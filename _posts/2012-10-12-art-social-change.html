<h3>Mildred Howard visits CSUMB Oct. 25</h3>

Mildred Howard is an epic part of the East Bay&#x2019;s cultural
landscape, according to the San Francisco Examiner.<br>
<br>
She has an impressive list of important projects including
installations in the De Young Museum, the San Francsico Museum of
Modern Art, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Wash., the San Jose
Museum of Art, and galleries in Boston and Los Angeles as well as
international exhibitions in Paris, Berlin, Cairo, and the United
Kingdom.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
As an artist, she says her cause is to fight to give a voice to
people, things and themes that are overlooked in society. She joins
objects of the past with present meaning, creating antique-looking
sculptures in reference to global socio-political relationships,
and riddled with metaphors of past, present and future.</p>
<p>The local community will have the opportunity to learn about
Howard&#x2019;s work when she visits CSU Monterey Bay on Oct. 25. Her free
talk, part of the Visiting Artists Series, will start at 6 p.m. in
the University Center living room. The University Center is located
on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Driving directions and a campus map
can be found <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>. &#xA0;</p>

educational programs, managed an art and communities program at San
Francisco&#x2019;s Exploratorium, and was executive director of Alice
Waters&#x2019; Edible Schoolyard Project. She&#x2019;s taught at just about every
university and art institution in the San Francisco Bay Area and
has also worked at Alameda County Juvenile Hall and Bay Area
jails.</p>
<p>Her visit is the second in this semester&#x2019;s series of visiting
artists. The last artist to visit this semester will be muralist
John Wehrle, who is scheduled to speak on Nov. 8.</p>
