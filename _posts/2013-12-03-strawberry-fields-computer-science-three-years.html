<p>When Mateo Sixtos drives to his computer science classes every
weekday, he takes a good, hard look at the strawberry fields he
first worked hen he was only 10 years old. . . . Today, he&apos;s
enrolled in a new, rigorous and academically daring college program
&#x2013; a collaboration between CSU Monterey Bay and Hartnell Community
College &#x2013; that promises to help students from the agricultural
Salinas Valley earn a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science in only
three years.<br>
