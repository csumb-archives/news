<p>Dr. Ruben Mendoza continues to win accolades for his work on
missions in California and the Southwest.</p>
<p>An archaeologist and founding faculty member at CSU Monterey
Bay, Dr. Mendoza has been invited to do a weeklong residency at
Arizona State University in June. He will deliver two presentations
as part of a program on research and digital preservation of
colonial missions. His topics: &#x201C;Canticle of the Sun:
Archaeoastronomy and Solar Eucharistic Workshop in the Millennial
New World,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Cross and the Blade: Discovery of the Serra
Chapel and the Archaeology of the Royal Presidio of Monterey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At the invitation of ASU&#x2019;s Hispanic Research Center, he will
meet with scholars with an eye to future collaboration. &#x201C;This
dovetails nicely with the work I am presently doing with the UNESCO
World Heritage List scholars and the National Park Service in
Texas, and my role as an advisory board member for the Monastery of
San Jeronimo de la Murtra in Spain . . . where King Ferdinand and
Queen Isabella first met Christopher Columbus upon his return from
his charter voyage to the New World,&#x201D; Dr. Mendoza said.</p>
<p>With a colleague, he has organized a symposium for the 2014
meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Austin, Texas.
The title: &#x201C;Feast, Famine or Fighting: Multiple Pathways to
Complexity.&#x201D;<br>
