<p>To celebrate Black History Month, California State University,
Monterey Bay invites the public to a free musical performance by
the group Voices of Freedom.</p>
<p>The hourlong concert will be held at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 8,
in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue, near the intersection with
Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus are available at
csumb.edu/map.</p>
<p>Oakland-based Voices of Freedom is comprised of members of
church choirs, students and faculty at several Bay Area colleges as
well as members of the community.</p>
<p>The program, &#x201C;Get Your Shout On,&#x201D; will include ancient Yoruba
chants from West Africa, and will demonstrate how Negro spirituals
derived from those chants. The program will end with a re-creation
of a ring-shout, a feature of the &#x201C;invisible&#x201D; church of enslaved
Africans and their American-born descendants. Singing, dancing and
percussion are involved; the audience will be invited to
participate.</p>
<p>The choir is accompanied by a battery of bat&#xE1; (sacred) drums,
led by master drummer Otobaji Stewart. Voices of Freedom&#x2019;s founder
and executive director Wanda Ravernell &#x2013; a former editor and writer
at the San Francisco Chronicle &#x2013; will provide historical and
spiritual context for the music.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Professor Umi Vaughan at
582-3116.</p>
