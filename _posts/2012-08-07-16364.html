CSUMB&#x2019;s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute&#xA0;brings 50-and-better
folks back to school</h3>
<p>What do Ulysses, art in the adobes and the Chinese economy have
in common?</p>
<p>They are among the classes that will be offered this semester
through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI &#x2013; at
California State University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="OLLI catalog for fall 2012" src="http://csumb.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/news/images/fall12_cover_thumbnail.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:322px">OLLI resumes this
fall for its sixth year with a diverse range of courses and
speakers specifically for those 50 and better.</p>
<p>OLLI at CSU Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher
Foundation, is part of a national network that recognizes learning
and exploration have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a
fresh look at themselves, their world, and the possibilities that
await them.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are a variety of writing classes; a
look at Russian life and culture; the art of the short film; coral
reefs and climate change; Elkhorn Slough: An Ecological Success
Story; the Science and Art of the Monterey Peninsula; and the
Whales of Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>New this year is a four-session Moss Landing Marine Science
Series that will cover Hawaiian monk seals, ocean pollution,
California leatherback turtles and local kelp research, all taught
by graduate student researchers.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a four-session
class, California Ballot: Death and Taxes, that will take a look at
the state initiatives and analyze what the November election
results mean for California.</p>
<p>Also offered are a free Friday lecture series that examines
issues of our time and a free authors series that offers the story
behind the story.</p>
<p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can
sign up for an annual membership &#x2013; which includes tuition for six
classes for $180, or four classes for $120. New this year is an
all-inclusive membership for $210, which includes an unlimited
number of courses. Memberships include discounts on campus and
other benefits.</p>
