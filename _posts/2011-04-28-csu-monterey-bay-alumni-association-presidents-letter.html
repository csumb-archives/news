<p>Dear alumni, friends, and family,</p>
<p>I often talk about the benefits of connecting to the Alumni
Association and participating in one of the many activities on
campus. The Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction is always
a wonderful event, and I am pleased to say it was very successful
again this year. I especially want to thank the members of the
board of directors and all the alumni volunteers for their
participation on Feb. 26. They, along with university staff and
faculty, did an amazing job helping to raise funds for future
scholarships.</p>
<p>This is your alma mater, and I hope you will join me in making
it as successful as possible. Visiting our newly redesigned
website, CSUMB.edu/alumni, is a means of staying connected to your
fellow alums and the university as a whole. You can also stay
engaged and find out about upcoming events by following CSUMB on
Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or through our monthly
e-newsletter.</p>
<p>I have made the choice to remain active in our university
through the Alumni Association. I hope you will join me by choosing
to <em>continue the vision, give back and stay connected.</em></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
April Lee, Business 2007<br>
President, CSUMB Alumni Association 2010-2011</p>
