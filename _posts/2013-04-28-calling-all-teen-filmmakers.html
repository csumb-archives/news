<h3>&#x2028;Submission deadline May 31 for Teen Film Festival</h3>
<p>Young filmmakers eager to see their work on a screen bigger than
YouTube will get the opportunity in the fall, when CSU Monterey Bay
will hold its fifth annual Teen Film Festival.</p>
<p><img alt="Teen Film Festival will be held Sept. 7" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/film-making-300x144_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:144px">The Teledramatic
Arts and Technology Department is accepting entries for the
festival, which will be held on Sept. 7 as part of the Monterey Bay
Film Festival&#x2019;s three-day run, Sept. 6-8. The deadline to apply is
May 31.<br>
<br>
Filmmakers between 13 and 19 years old are invited to submit films
and videos up to five minutes in length. Entries may be in English
or Spanish and there is no entry fee. <a href="http://montereybayfilmfestival.com." rel="nofollow">Entries may be
submitted online</a>.<br>
<br>
TAT students will organize the event and handle the judging,
according to Professor Enid Baxter Blader.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&apos;s an educational experience for our students, who want to go
out in the world and have their films screened in film festivals. A
great way to understand that process is to curate a film festival,&quot;
Blader said.<br>
<br>
CSUMB also hopes the festival will serve as a way to interest local
teens who might not have considered going to college. By inviting
them to campus and showing them what the university offers, they
may consider enrolling.<br>
<br>

teenagers are encouraged to enter the competition, it&apos;s also open
to teenagers from around the world.<br>
<br>
Last year&apos;s event drew more than 200 entries with films submitted
fromEcuador, South Africa, Venezuela, Salinas, Soledad and Los
Angeles. Close to 400 people attended the festival, making it the
most attended event in four years. Teen filmmakers from all over
California, their families and community members came to enjoy the
show.<br>
<br>
The Monterey Bay Film Festival will also feature three programs
curated by Mike Plante. Plante is an associate programmer of the
Sundance Film Festival, and curates many other festivals
internationally. This will be his fourth year as the programmer of
the Monterey Bay Film Festival.</p>
