<p>The publilc is invited to witness and celebrate the on-going
renewal of Salinas&apos; Chinatown by attending the fourth annual Asian
Festival on Saturday, April 30, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Demonstrations of kendo and ikebana (flower arranging), tai chi,
taiko drumming and Filipino folk dancing will be held throughout
the day. The Buddhist Temple, the Confucius Church and the Filipino
Cultural Center will open their doors to the community. Asian
cuisine will be available. Guided tours of the area will leave the
Confucius Church on the hour.<br>
<br>
The Asian Festival is an effort to unite three ethnic communities &#x2013;
Chinese, Japanese and Filipino &#x2013; as they share their history and
culture in one of Salinas&apos; most historic areas. The festival will
be held in the area bordered by California, Soledad, Lake and Calle
Cebu streets.<br>
<br>
The festival is part of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Chinatown Renewal
Project, which is leading the effort to revitalize a marginalized
area of Salinas. Since 2006, the revitalization process has
included a neighborhood garden and community learning center and
the @risk Art Gallery, a project of the Franciscan Workers.The
community is invited to this free event.<br>
