CSU Monterey Bay got into the holiday spirit by making cards for
military members serving overseas.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think anytime we can find a way to thank our service men and
women, we should jump at the opportunity,&#x201D; said Angelina Orozco, an
outfielder on the softball team and secretary of the
Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These holiday cards were a small but personal and fun way for
our SAAC reps to show that Otter Athletics supports our
troops.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The cards will be sent to Soldiers&#x2019; Angels, a Pasadena-based
nonprofit organization that supports members of the military.</p>

began when military mom Patti Patton-Bader discovered that her
son&apos;s fellow soldiers were not receiving the home-front support
they needed. It quickly spread from a mom and her circle of friends
supporting one Army unit with care packages, to a worldwide
organization with hundreds of thousand of volunteers supporting
American service members of every branch in a myriad of ways.<br>
