<h3>Kicks off March 4 with talk on economic development</h3>
<p>With the theme, &#x201C;Flourish Monterey County,&#x201D; this year&#x2019;s
President&#x2019;s Speaker Series at California State University, Monterey
Bay will get under way on March 4 when Mary Jo Waits visits
campus.</p>
<p><img alt="Mary Jo Waits" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mjwaits.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:300px">Ms. Waits,
director of the Economic, Human Services and Workforce Division of
the National Governors Association, was one of the most
thought-provoking speakers at the recent colloquium on Fort Ord
redevelopment. She will expand on her ideas on how to leverage
university research to enhance economic development.</p>
<p>One of the messages that emerged from the colloquium was the
need to move beyond jurisdictional battles and take a comprehensive
look at what makes economic and environmental sense for the area.
In her talk, Ms. Waits will continue the discussion begun at the
colloquium.</p>
<p>Her presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on
Sixth Avenue near A Street. Driving directions and a campus map are
available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are
necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling
the World Theater box office at 582-4580, or going online at
csumb.edu/rsvp.</p>
<p>The series continues on March 28, when Dr. David Kennedy of
Harvard&#x2019;s John F. Kennedy School of Government visits. He directed
the Boston Gun Project, which sharply reduced the youth homicide
rate in that city. Jeff Edmondson of Strive Together, the national
group that works to improve the cradle-to-career pipeline, will
visit on April 9.</p>
<p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
role as a community resource, providing forums for thoughtful and
provocative discussions that can impact thought and action on
issues important to our community.</p>
