invited to a screening of Godfrey Reggio&#x2019;s prophetic 1982 film,
<em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> at 4 p.m., Oct. 1, in the TAT studio.<br>
<br>
The director will make a presentation and then screen the film.
<em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> &#x2013; &#x201C;life out of balance&#x201D; in the Hopi language
&#x2013; is a visual tone poem with no dialogue and no conventional plot,
which the director describes as a reversal of the typical saying
that &#x201C;a picture is worth a thousand words,&#x201D; and is instead &#x201C;a
thousand images to convey the power of one word.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The film presents a stunning montage of images from urban traffic
to desert vistas to electronic circuits, accompanied by a score
from Philip Glass to explore the threats posed to nature by modern
civilization. One critic called it a &#x201C;unique, contemplative
film.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Walter Ryce in the Monterey County Weekly: &quot;It is a
wordless work that said much about the world then (1982), and the
world we live in now.&quot;&#xA0;<br>
<br>
The showing and talk kicks off the Philip Glass Center for the
Arts, Science and the Environment&apos;s annual Days and Nights Festival
at Big Sur&apos;s Henry Miller Library and Carmel&apos;s Sunset Center.<br>
