<h3>Forum explores issues of data mining as we enter the cloud</h3>
<p>Every time we click on a website, pay for something with a
credit card or drive across a toll bridge using FastTrak, we leave
a digital trail.<br>
<br>
<img alt="March 28 forum examines issues of data mining" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/essay_bazalgette.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:250px">Who&#x2019;s paying
attention to that trail? It&apos;s not just Big Brother Government; it&apos;s
also Big Brother Google, Big Brother Target and Big Brother
Facebook. It&apos;s called data mining and it happens because our
digital data is valuable, especially when it&apos;s viewed
demographically.</p>
<p>As our digital culture embraces the promises of cloud computing
and doing almost everything online, is it possible for individuals
to retain any sense of privacy?<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s the topic that will be discussed at the annual Ethics Forum
sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s schools of Business and Information
Technology and Communication Design. The free event will be held
from 3 to 5 p.m. on March 28 in the University Center on Sixth
Avenue and B Street.<br>
<br>
Panelists include Lee Tien, senior staff attorney with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation; Alec Arago from Congressman Sam
Farr&#x2019;s office; William Boogess (retired) from the Defense Manpower
Data Center; Adam Swidler of Google; and Cheryl Washington,
information security officer for the University of California
system.<br>
<br>
Chip Lenno, CSUMB&#x2019;s chief information officer, will moderate the
panel.<br>
