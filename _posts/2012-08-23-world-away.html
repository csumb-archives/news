<p>By the time school starts on Aug. 27, approximately 60
international students will have settled in to campus life at CSU
Monterey Bay. Some plan to spend a year before returning home;
others intend to earn a degree.</p>
<p><img alt="International students arrive at S.F. International on Aug. 22" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/recrop_international_students.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:211px">And another 20
students are on campus through the National Student Exchange, a
kind of domestic exchange program that allows students from other
universities to attend classes at CSUMB for a semester or a full
year.</p>
<p>The first group of 27 arrived at San Francisco International
Airport on Aug 22. Holly White, international programs manager, and
several CSUMB students were on hand to meet them.</p>
<p>According to White, many international students come to CSUMB to
study business and marine science. Biology and communications are
also popular choices. Most come to improve their English and to
develop an understanding of American culture.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our location is the big draw,&#x201D; White said. &#x201C;And our small class
size is appealing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The exchange works in both directions &#x2013; 88 CSUMB students are
headed abroad this semester and another 20 will join them in the
spring.</p>
