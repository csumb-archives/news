<p>Heather Kelley has been named a recipient of the Dr. Nancy
Foster Scholarship for outstanding graduate students in the fields
of marine biology and coastal resource management.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Heather Kelley" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/heather_kelley_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height:453px">The scholarships
are presented annually by the Department of Commerce&apos;s National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br>
<br>
Kelley will enter the Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy
master&#x2019;s program at CSUMB in the fall.</p>
<p>&quot;I came to CSUMB for graduate school because I wanted to work on
applied marine conservation issues at the intersection of
technology and marine biology,&quot; Kelley said.</p>
<p>Since January, she has worked with the university&#x2019;s Institute
for Applied Marine Ecology (IfAME), under the direction of Dr.
James Lindholm.</p>
<p>Her work on IfAME&#x2019;s North Central Coast Marine Protected Areas
monitoring project helped her secure the scholarship.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Heather&#x2019;s proposal to NOAA leveraged her involvement in that
project because several of our sample sites occur in the Monterey
Bay and Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuaries,&#x201D; Dr.
Lindholm said.</p>
<p>Another reason for coming to CSUMB after earning her
undergraduate degree at UCLA was the emphasis on science
communication.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there is a gap between the scientific research being
conducted and what the public can easily access and understand.
Training from CSUMB with a focus on science communications and
technology will allow me to better interpret the research of
scientists and engage public audiences in ocean conservation,&quot; she
said.<br>
<br>
The scholarship will cover the cost of tuition and provide two
years of salary to support her work on the project as she focuses
on applying the data derived from remotely operated vehicles to the
management of National Marine Sanctuaries. And it will cover the
cost of at least one trip to New England to work with colleagues at
the Stellwagen Bank NMS.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Heather is currently on a 36-day research cruise along the North
Central Coast, where she has quickly established herself as a key
member of our team,&#x201D; Dr. Lindholm said.<br>
&#x201C;The scholarship is a great opportunity for Heather and we can all
expect great things from her in the coming years.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program recognizes outstanding
scholarship and encourages independent graduate level research in
marine sciences &#x2014; particularly by female and minority students.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the program soon after Dr. Foster&#x2019;s death in
June 2000, as a means of honoring her life&#x2019;s work as a marine
scientist and contribution to the nation. The program is
administered through NOAA&#x2019;s Office of Education.</p>
