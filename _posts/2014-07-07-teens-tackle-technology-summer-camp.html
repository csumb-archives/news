<p>Sixty high school students are on campus July 7-15, learning how
to program robots and design video games.</p>
<p><img alt="Campers learn to program a Lego robot" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/programming_a_robot.png" style="width:300px; height:195px; float:left">This is the second
year for CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Technology Innovation Summer Camp. The
camp filled up quickly; 26 students come from local schools
including Carmel, York, Seaside, Marina, Salinas and Millennium
high schools. Another 34 are international students, who are
getting a taste of American college life and learning about
CSUMB.</p>

classroom,&#x201D; Eric Tao, chair of the School of Information Technology

programming and robotics. In addition to the&#xA0;<img alt="Students program their robots to cover a " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/robot_course.png" style="width:250px; height:167px; float:right">classroom work,

field trips at the end of each day.</p>
