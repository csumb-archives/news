Jessica Moss is this year&#x2019;s recipient of the Monterey County Film
Commission&#x2019;s student scholarship.</p>
<p>Moss is a senior at Cal State Monterey Bay, where she studies
Cinematic Arts and Technology. She plans to use the $2,000 grant to
help with expenses for her capstone project, &#x201C;The Maw,&#x201D; an animated
film short.</p>

challenge of an animated film, which entails doing frame-by-frame
traditional animation in addition to digital animation. It requires
specialized equipment as well as an extended time commitment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With animation I will be drawing approximately 4,000 frames
over the course of two semesters and three summer months,&#x201D; Moss
said. &#x201C;Thanks to this award, I can upgrade equipment, purchase
light boxes and more.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As a student employee at CSUMB, she presents camera and
after-effects workshops and helps other students with technical
issues. She recently served as director of photography on a fellow
student&#x2019;s short film, &#x201C;Will o&#x2019;-the-Wisp.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The annual Monterey County Film Commission&#x2019;s Director Emeritus
Richard Tyler Scholarship Award is named in memory of Tyler, who
served for 20 years on the film commission&#x2019;s board of directors. It
was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of
film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are
enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was
established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation
for Monterey County.</p>
<p>The scholarship was first awarded in 2008 and has gone to CSUMB
students each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo shared the
inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez &#x2013; who now works in the
Cinematic Arts Department as a media specialist &#x2013; was the winner.
Rachel Asendorf received the award in 2010; Dominic Parisi won it
in 2011; Joey Blackburn won in 2012, and Nicholas Fryou was last
year&#x2019;s recipient.&#xA0;</p>
