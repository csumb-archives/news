<h2>We&#x2019;re No. 1</h2>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s website has earned even more recognition in
the world of higher education web design.</p>
<p>In mid-January, it topped the list of best redesigned sites for
2011 compiled by Karine Joly on her blog, CollegeWebEditor.com. The
list was based on Nick DeNardis&#x2019; reviews on his video blog,
EduCheckup.</p>
<p class="pullquote">Other top sites, according to EDU Checkup:
University of San Diego, Georgetown University, University of
Melbourne, Vassar</p>
<p>Every week since 2008, DeNardis has selected a college or
university site for comprehensive review. He looks at them from the
point of view of a first-time visitor, while critiquing the design,
information architecture and code of the sites. He issues each a
grade.</p>
<p>In November, DeNardis looked at CSUMB.EDU and was impressed
enough to give it an A+. He praised the site for its design, as
well as its architecture and general functionality, awarding it a
total of 292 points of a possible 300.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a great feeling to review a site that just works,&#x201D;
DeNardis said on his blog.</p>
<p>Check out his <a href="http://educheckup.com/2011/11/04/california-state-university-monterey-bay-episode-280/" rel="nofollow">video review</a><br>
<br>
DeNardis is the associate director of web communications at Wayne
State University and a staff writer at .eduGuru, a higher education
marketing and web development blog</p>
<p>The redesigned website debuted on Oct. 25, 2010, after more than
a year of work by members of the Strategic Communications and
Information Technology departments and an outside contractor, White
Whale Web Services of Oakland.</p>
<p>The redesigned site features work contributed by members of the
campus community, including student-produced photos and videos. The
site has also been geared for ease of use, with a blend of
need-to-know information and room to click around and discover
unexpected stories about the university, and its students and
faculty.</p>
