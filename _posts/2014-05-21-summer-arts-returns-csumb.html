weeks long; some start on June 27, others begin on July 14.
Students study with well-known master teachers in dance, creative
writing, filmmaking and videography, music, new media, theater and
visual arts.</p>
<p>Classes are open to community members as well as college
students, who earn three to six credits. Scholarships are
available.</p>

Cuba and Brazil.&#x201D; The course will run from June 30 to July 13.
Applications will be accepted through late June.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Learn from and play with Grammy Award-nominated percussionist
and bandleader John Santos, and Mario Pam, musical director of the
famous percussion group Il&#xEA; Aiy&#xEA;, direct from Salvador, Brazil.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Join the &#x201C;reunion&#x201D; and conversation between the
African-derived music traditions of Cuba and Brazil, and explore
various traditional Cuban and Brazilian genres as well as fusions
of these distinct but related rhythms.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Learn and perform a range of music styles from Cuba and
Brazil, including sacred rhythms of Candombl&#xE9; and Santer&#xED;a, samba,
bai&#xE3;o, maracat&#xFA;, bemb&#xE9;, rumba and comparsa.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Develop familiarity with a variety of Afro-Cuban and
Afro-Brazilian percussion instruments and understand the role of
each instrument within the music as a whole.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Understand the socio-historical contexts in which the rhythms
were born, the current environments that sustain them, and the
intimate connections between these two great traditions.</p>
<p>The course will culminate in a public performance by the
participants.</p>
<p>Aimee Suzara, a lecturer in the Division of Humanities and
Communication, will coordinate &#x201C;Social Action Writing: Personal to
Political, Words to Work.&#x201D; The course will run from July 14-27.

work span poetry, nonfiction, fiction and theater.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Learn basic craft elements of poetry and prose.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Generate new writing and revise work for performance.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Examine how writing, as social action, can break silences, bear
witness and make change.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Shape language into story, revelation, weapon, healing.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Gain insight on how to get work published, seen and heard in the
world &#x2013; from schools to prisons, from publication to touring.</p>
<p>The course will culminate in a public reading of student
work.</p>
<p>CSU Summer Arts is dedicated to transforming artists&#x2019; lives by
broadening their creative skills, subject matter knowledge and
ability to represent their work in public performance or
exhibition. Because it is similar to an artistic retreat and
apprenticeship program, it also helps students build bridges to
future employment.<br>
<br>
Have an interest in traveling to Italy? &quot;Drawing and Painting in
Florence&quot; is another Summer Arts option. <a href="http://www.csusummerarts.org" rel="nofollow">See a list of all
