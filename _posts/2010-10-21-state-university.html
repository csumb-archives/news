<p>President Dianne Harrison urged faculty and staff of Cal State
Monterey Bay to answer a call to service and excellence for the
university and its students in her annual State of the University
address in August.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2026; In spite of the still-sluggish economy and the unresolved
state budget, I have never been so proud of our entire university
or felt more confident of its continued progress,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison pointed out the positive response the university
has received from the organization reviewing its application for
re-accreditation. &#x201C;California State University, Monterey Bay has
turned an important corner from its formative years and is maturing
as a comprehensive university for the 21st century,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>More than 1,100 new students &#x2013; freshmen and transfers &#x2013; attended
campus orientation sessions during the summer. But Dr. Harrison
reminded her audience that more than 3,200 qualified applicants had
to be turned away because of a budget-imposed cap on
enrollment.</p>
<p>The new students, she pointed out, &#x201C;come with high expectations,
and they are counting on us to help them achieve their goals &#x2013;
regardless of the state budget.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Money will continue to be tight for years to come, she said. &#x201C;A
scarcity of public dollars has become the new normal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Dr. Harrison quickly moved beyond money to talk about a few
of the university&apos;s recent accomplishments.</p>
<p>The biology, psychology, kinesiology, business, math and
computer science majors have clearly resonated with students. And
so does the new Master of Social Work program, which started its
first class with approximately 40 students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We will not be stymied by state budgets or be satisfied to
simply ride out the storm,&#x201D; Dr. Harrison said. &#x201C;Together we will
continue to innovate and be leaders in our disciplines and services
and in higher education.&#x201D;</p>
