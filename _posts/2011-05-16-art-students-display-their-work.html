<p>In order to graduate, CSU Monterey Bay students in the Visual
and Public Art Department create a capstone project &#x2013; a sort of
senior thesis of art. Mounted together, they form an exhibit open
to the public.<br>
<br>
The capstone projects are the final capping of skills, knowledge,
values and commitments of the individual students. In these
projects, student artists have identified public themes and
critical issues that are relevant to themselves and their
audience.<br>
<br>
This year&#x2019;s exhibit gathers 35 works in a show of creative force.
The exhibit will open on Monday, May 16, with an artists&#x2019; reception
at 6 p.m. in the Visual and Public Art Building (Bldg. 71). The
public is invited. The art department is housed in buildings
located at the intersection of Inter-Garrison Road and Fifth
Avenue. An exhibit catalog can be found <a href="http://vpa2.csumb.edu/capstone/capstone2011/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The work will be on display until the final capstone and medal
ceremony, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Friday, May 20. The public is invited
to this free event or to view the exhibit during normal business
hours. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br>
<br>
The campuswide Capstone Festival will take place Thursday and
Friday, May 19 and 20. For a schedule of capstone presentations in
