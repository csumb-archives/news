<p>Paul Meltzer, a Santa Cruz attorney, has donated his 46-foot
Hatteras sport fishing yacht to CSU Monterey Bay for use in the
university&#x2019;s marine science program.</p>
<p>The boat will be renamed &#x201C;Harold Heath&#x201D; in honor of his
great-grandfather, a marine scientist who was a Stanford University
professor for nearly 40 years and led research at Stanford&apos;s
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove. Dr. Heath and his family
lived across the street from the Marine Station campus.</p>

Mapping Lab, where it will support marine research, training and
education. It will also be used to support remotely operated
vehicles and habitat survey work done by the university&apos;s Institute
for Applied Marine Ecology.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Harold Heath will allow us to take the Seafloor Mapping Lab
to a new level of performance and service,&#x201D; said Dr. Rikk Kvitek, a
professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and
director of the Seafloor Mapping Lab. The lab conducts marine
habitat survey work and has been instrumental in the ongoing
California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first
comprehensive, high-resolution map of California&apos;s state waters &#x2013;
from the shoreline out three nautical miles. The project involves
industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final
products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and
coastal geology in unprecedented detail.</p>
<p>One of the first uses of the Harold Heath will be to map the
last remaining section of state waters, along the southern Big Sur
coast. &#x201C;Because of the remote nature of this part of the coast, the
work will require that we spend four or five days at a time at
sea,&#x201D; Dr. Kvitek said. &#x201C;The Hatteras is very well equipped, in
excellent condition and is ideally suited for this work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s that kind of useful research that inspired Mr. Meltzer, an
avid deep sea fisherman, to make the gift.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The university is conducting interesting and important marine
research that will be immediately useful. This is exactly the kind
of research project that would have fascinated my
great-grandfather. My father was a commercial fisherman and he
would have also been thrilled to see a detailed map of the sea
floor,&#x201D; Mr. Meltzer said.</p>
<p>Dr. Heath was involved in coastal marine survey research off the
coast of California, Alaska, Mexico, Japan and Brazil. He was one
of the first professors at Stanford University, where he joined the
Department of Zoology in 1894. He spent most of his scientific life
at the Palo Alto campus and at Stanford&#x2019;s Hopkins Marine Station.
He first taught at the Pacific Grove facility in the summer of
1895. Dr. Heath retired in 1933, but continued his research at the
Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. He died in 1951. In a
memorial tribute, his Stanford colleagues described him as &#x201C;kindly,
quizzical and inspiring.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Harold Heath will be berthed along the Coast Guard pier in
the Monterey harbor. &#x201C;We will begin outfitting the boat to support
seafloor mapping, diving, remotely operated vehicles and video
tow-sled surveys right away,&#x201D; Dr. Kvitek said.</p>
