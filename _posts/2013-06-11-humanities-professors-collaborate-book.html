<p>&quot;Dialogue and Deliberation,&quot; a new book by Professors Debian
Marty and Josina Makau, was recently published by Waveland
Press.</p>
<p>Amazon says of the book:</p>
<p>Across our differences, people everywhere wish to be heard, to
be known, and to be understood. When these needs are met,
individuals have the potential to flourish, and communities can
work together in common cause. Yet, in the current argument
culture, the power of communication to meet these needs remains
largely untapped, and the ability to resolve shared problems is
compromised. &quot;Dialogue and Deliberation&quot; explores the roots of this
communication crisis and offers a realistic means to reconnect, to
build community, and to make just and wise decisions together.</p>
<p><a href="http://hcom.csumb.edu/josina-makau-0" rel="nofollow">Dr. Makau</a> has a Ph.D. in rhetoric from UC Berkeley.
<a href="http://hcom.csumb.edu/debian-marty" rel="nofollow">Dr.
Marty</a> earned a doctorate in communication studies at Ohio State
University. Both are professors in the Division of Humanities and
Communication.&#xA0;</p>
<p>In 2001, the two collaborated on another book, &quot;Cooperative
Argumentation: A Model for Deliberative Community.&quot;&#xA0;</p>
<p><em>Dr. Debian Marty discusses the importance of recognizing
communication patterns in order to create a more peaceful and just
society <a href="http://youtu.be/dyTewGJF_6A" rel="nofollow">in
