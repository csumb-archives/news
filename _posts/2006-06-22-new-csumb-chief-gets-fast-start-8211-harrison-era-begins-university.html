Some of Dianne Harrison&apos;s moving boxes remain unpacked at her
California State University, Monterey Bay residence. Judging from
her schedule, they&apos;ll stay that way awhile. Since taking the helm
as CSUMB&apos;s new president, Harrison has kept busy introducing
herself to faculty, students, staff and anybody else with a stake
in the university&apos;s success.<br>
