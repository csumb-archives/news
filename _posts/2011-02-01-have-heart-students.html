<h4>Annual event at CSUMB raises money for&#xA0; scholarships</h4>
<p>KSBW-TV meteorologist Jim Vanderzwaan will help auction off
dozens of items &#x2013; including tickets to the Panetta Lecture Series,
jewelry, lavish dinners and lots of wine &#x2013; at the 13th annual Have
a Heart for Students dinner and auction at California State
University, Monterey Bay on Feb. 26.<br>
<br>
The goal is to raise money for student scholarships, a need that is
more urgent than ever because of the financial crunch many families
are experiencing.<br>
<br>
Dozens of faculty and staff volunteers take on the roles of waiters
and wine stewards, all in an effort to raise money to help the 65
percent of CSUMB students who receive some form of financial
aid.<br>
<br>
This year&#x2019;s planning committee is co-chaired by Leslie Taylor and
Shahin Anable. &#x201C;Efforts like this are really community events,&#x201D;
Anable said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re about our future &#x2013; wherever we live.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Live and silent auctions will highlight the event, which will be
held in the ballroom of the University Center on Sixth Avenue. A
reception and silent auction will get under way at 5 p.m. Dinner
will start at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Tickets are $85 per person and can be reserved by calling
582-4141. For more information or to purchase tickets online, visit
