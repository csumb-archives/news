<p><img alt="The Alley Cats visit campus Oct. 20" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/alleycats1.jpg" style="float:left; width:419px; height:238px">By bringing their
own contemporary style to tunes from that era, The Alley Cats
appeal to fans of all ages, breathing new life into everyone&apos;s
favorite doo-wop classics.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, doo-wop is an ebullient, rhythm and
blues-fueled harmony vocal style where one person sings lead and
the others harmonize or mimic the sounds of instruments behind
them. It rose to prominence in the 1950s. The first real boy bands,
before N&#x2019;Sync and the Backstreet Boys, were doo-wop groups like the
Del Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts, and in the Motown era, The
Temptations, Four Tops and Miracles.</p>
<p>The four members of The Alley Cats are a perfect blend both
vocally and personally. Every Alley Cat performance is accompanied
by the sounds of laughter and voices joining in to sing the
melodies we all know and love.</p>
<p>The Cats&apos; engaging wit and humor have won over audiences
nationally as they relate directly to the crowd with jokes, stories
and audience participation that appeals to young and old alike.
Tight harmonies, universal humor, and unbelievable a cappella
energy have made The Alley Cats America&apos;s premier doo-wop
group.</p>
<p>The group has performed with Jay Leno, the Beach Boys and at the
White House.</p>
<p>Tickets are $40 premium, $29 general. Discounts are available
for students and seniors. Tickets can be purchased online at
csumb.edu/worldtheater or by calling the box office at
582-4580.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>
