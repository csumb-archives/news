<p>The 106-foot-high, sediment-filled San Clemente Dam on the
Carmel River will be torn down in August.&#xA0;Federal, state and
local officials said the largest dam removal in California&apos;s
history will be a crucial environmental restoration project that
could serve as a precedent for other dams in the U.S.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
Every big dam removal project poses a large-scale environmental
experiment, California State University Monterey Bay professor Doug
Smith said. Carmel River&apos;s dam is especially worthy of study
because removal crews are using a new technique designed to keep
all the trapped sediment in place, he said.<br>
<br>
Luckily, CSUMB graduate student Sheldon Leiker and undergraduate
August Delforge don&apos;t mind getting their hands dirty and their feet
wet in the name of environmental science.<br>
