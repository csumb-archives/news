<p><img alt="piano keys" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/piano_keys.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:233px">Highlights from
&quot;West Side Story,&quot; the hit Broadway musical and film, will be
performed at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s spring concert on May 4.</p>
<p>Featuring music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen
Sondheim, the musical takes the star-crossed-lovers story of &quot;Romeo
and Juliet&quot; and sets it in a gang-rich area of 1950s New York
City.</p>
<p>Familiar songs &#x2013; Maria, Tonight, I Feel Pretty, Somewhere, Jets
&#x2013; will be performed by students in the university&#x2019;s musical theater
production class, the concert band and CSUMB singers.</p>
<p>The concert will get under way at 3 p.m. in the World Theater on
Sixth Avenue between A and B streets on the CSUMB campus. Driving
directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>While the concert is free, attendees must purchase a parking
permit from a dispenser on the lot adjacent to the theater.</p>
<p>For more information or to request disability accommodations,
call 582-3009.</p>
<p><strong>PIANO, VOICE RECITALS</strong><br>
<br>
Students of Professor Carlos Tottress will also present two
recitals in May.</p>
<p>On May 9, two dozen students will give a piano recital starting
at 6 p.m. in the Music Building, located on Sixth Avenue near
Butler Street.</p>
<p>The following day, the Music Building will be the site of a
voice recital, featuring more than 20 students. Admission to both
events is free.</p>
