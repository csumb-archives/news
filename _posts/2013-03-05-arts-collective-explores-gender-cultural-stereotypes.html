<h3>M.O.B. visits campus March 14</h3>
<p>For more than 18 years, Eliza Barrios, Jenifer Wofford and
Reanne Estrada have worked collaboratively as the arts collective
Mail Order Brides/M.O.B.<br>
<br>

group explores gender, race and cultural stereotypes of Filipinas
in work that has included karaoke videos, museum makeovers,
photographic psychodramas, installations and posters. The name is a
play on the controversial practice of arranged marriages through
international introduction agencies.<br>
<br>
Barrios and Wofford will visit CSU Monterey Bay on March 14 as part
of the university&#x2019;s Visiting Artist series. Their free presentation
will get under way at 6 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center.</p>
<p>They will talk about their individual work and then discuss
M.O.B.&#x2019;s work currently on view in the exhibition, &#x201C;New Stories
from the Edge of Asia,&#x201D; at the San Jose Museum of Art. In the
exhibit, artists take on identity issues &#x2013; Asian identity in
particular &#x2013; via video, film, multimedia works, photography and
performance art.</p>
<p>M.O.B.&#x2019;s work has been seen at the De Young Museum, Yerba Buena
Center for the Arts and the Chinatown Cultural Center in San
Francisco; the Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara; and Green
Papaya Art Projects in Manila, the Philippines.<br>
<br>
The Alumni and Visitors Center is located on the corner of Gen. Jim
Moore Boulevard and Inter-Garrison Road on the CSUMB campus.
