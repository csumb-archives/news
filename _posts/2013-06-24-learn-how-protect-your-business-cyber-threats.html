<p>Is your small business safe from cyber threats? Do you have an
Internet security policy for your employees? Do you have a
checklist for how to protect your business data on all your
electronic devices?</p>
<p>If the answer to these questions is no or you are unsure about
the latest and best precautions to take, there&apos;s an easy way to
learn how to protect your business in cyberspace, courtesy of the
Small Business Development Center and the Wireless Education and
Technology Center at CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Presentations &#x2013; available in English and Spanish and
closed-captioned &#x2013; are posted online at <a href="http://sbdc.csumb.edu/cyber-security" title="http://sbdc.csumb.edu/cyber-security">http://sbdc.csumb.edu/cyber-security</a>
and can easily be downloaded.</p>
<p>They cover topics including information security when using
wi-fi; how to market your business safely online; and how to
safeguard your e-waste. A variety of videos, links, worksheets and
other resources are also available at the site.</p>
