<p>Looking for a way to reduce the stress of tax season? CSU
Monterey Bay student participants in the Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance &#x2013; VITA &#x2013; program may have an answer.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Federal tax refund checks" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/refund_checks.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px; float:left">Until the end of
tax season, volunteers from the College of Business will provide
free assistance with state and federal income tax
preparation.<br>
<br>
The VITA program is sponsored by United Way Monterey County. The
service is available at eight county locations, including the
Marina library where students are on duty noon to 3 p.m. every
other Saturday from Feb. 22 to April 5.<br>
<br>
All volunteers must pass the rigorous Internal Revenue Service
examinations to participate.<br>
<br>
Families and individuals who earned less than $57,000 in 2013 are
eligible. Filers must bring photo identification, Social Security
card or ITIN card for workers and all family members, their W-2 and
1099 forms and a copy of last year&#x2019;s return. It&apos;s not necessary to
make an appointment.&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Tax forms will be filed electronically. If a refund is due, it will
be deposited in the taxpayer&apos;s account in approximately 10
days.<br>
<br>
According to Dr. Cathy Ku, professor of accounting at CSUMB, it&#x2019;s a
good service learning opportunity for students. The first year &#x2013;
2010 &#x2013; five students participated. In 2011, 20 students volunteered
at eight locations in the county; in 2012, the number of volunteers
grew to 42.</p>
<p>Last year, 16 students and Dr. Ku worked as volunteers,
accounting for approximately 20 pecent of the total number of
participants in the program countywide. The CSUMB contingent helped
approximately 335 families secure refunds of $462,000, money that
helped to stimulate the local economy.</p>
<p>There is no charge for the tax preparation, no charge for direct
deposit to the taxpayer&#x2019;s bank account and no hidden fees. A list
of community locations, dates and hours, is available on the
