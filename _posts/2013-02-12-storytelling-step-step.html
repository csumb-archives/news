<h3>Dance group performs at CSU Monterey Bay</h3>
<p>The community is invited to celebrate Black History Month with
<a href="http://www.stepafrika.org/aboutus.htm" rel="nofollow">Step
Afrika</a> when the group visits CSU Monterey Bay on Feb. 21.</p>
<p><img alt="Step Afrika will visit CSUMB Feb. 21 as part of Black History History Month " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/step_afrika_small_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:208px">Stepping is a
unique dance tradition created by African American college
students. The body is used as an instrument to create intricate
rhythms and sounds through a combination of footsteps, claps and
spoken word.</p>
<p>The tradition grew out of the song and dance rituals practiced
by historically African American fraternities and sororities in the
early 1900s. Moviegoers got their first glimpse of stepping in
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZLxiWqmGus" rel="nofollow">Spike Lee&apos;s 1988 film &quot;School Daze.</a>&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Jacqui Malone, a professor of dance at the City
University of New York, stepping is a rising art form and an
important part of America&#x2019;s artistic and cultural heritage. In her
book, &#x201C;<a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/47pkg2ab9780252065088.html" rel="nofollow">Steppin&#x2019; on the Blues</a>,&#x201D; she says stepping is
&#x201C;one of the most exciting dance forms to evolve in the 20th
century.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As the first professional company devoted to stepping,
Washington, D.C.-based Step Afrika brings high-energy performance
to the stage: a feast for both the eyes and the ears.</p>
<p>The performance will start at 7 p.m. in CSUMB&#x2019;s World Theater,
located on Sixth Avenue near A Street. Tickets are $15 and are
available by calling the box office at 582-4580 or <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater" rel="nofollow">onli</a><a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater" rel="nofollow">ne</a>.&#xA0;Seating
is general admission.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The event is sponsored by the Otter Student Union, Associated
Students and the Otter Cross Cultural Center.</p>
<p><em>Stepping is tap dance without tap shoes, James Brown without
the music of the JBs, Cab Calloway sans piano, a marching band
without John Philip Sousa. It is jazz, funk, rhythm and blues, and
rap without instruments. Stepping is lean and mean. The music comes
from the synchronized interplay of hands and feet, from chants and
hollers. It is a way to make music using the body as
instrument.</em><br>
