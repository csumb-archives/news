Binaba, a small village in northeast Ghana, brothers Napoleon,
Joseph, Isaac, Francis and JJ Sabbah have performed for
enthusiastic audiences in the U.S. and Africa, and have
collaborated with musicians including Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>The group specializes in traditional dance and drum rhythms,
using the kone, siyak, binbill, and the bintitat, all instruments
made in their village. They sing about peace, happiness and
togetherness.</p>
<p>The audience will have an opportunity to ask the artists about
Ghanaian culture, historical and contemporary ties between West
Africa and the wider African Diaspora and other topics in a
question-and-answer session following the performance.</p>
<p>The performance is free, but a parking permit must be purchased.
The Music Hall is located on Sixth Avenue, between Butler Street
and Col. Durham Road.</p>
