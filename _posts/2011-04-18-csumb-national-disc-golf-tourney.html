<h2>THE PERFECT FLING</h2>
<p>Disc golfers representing three dozen colleges and universities
will compete in the fifth annual Collegiate Disc Golf Championships
April 14-17 in North Augusta, S.C.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay earned an automatic berth by virtue of its tie
for 11th in last year&#x2019;s tournament. The Otters, who were scheduled
to leave on Tuesday, April 12, go in as the No. 9-ranked team in
the nation.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The national team championship will be decided at the tourney,
as well as singles and doubles titles. The top six individual
finishers will earn &quot;All American&quot; honors.</p>

team are&#xA0;Danny Messina, Brandon White,&#xA0;Clark Hardenbergh,
Ross Sauceda,&#xA0;Samuel Bahlenhorst and Brian Ramler.</p>
<p>&#x2028;&#x2028;Unlike the contestants at that better-known golf event in
Augusta, Georgia &#x2013; about five minutes away &#x2013; the college golfers
take to the air. Like their counterparts in that other sport, the
players will hike around the 18-hole courses at the Hippodrome Disc
Golf Complex carrying drivers and putters. But instead of clubs
made of graphite, they use discs made of durable plastic.<br>
<br>
Scoring in disc golf is similar to regular or, as the players say,
&quot;ball&quot; golf. Players get a certain number of strokes, or tosses, to
hit the target &#x2013; in disc golf, a basket.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
The sport is growing in the college ranks. The first national
championship, in 2007, drew a field of six teams; this year&#x2019;s field
has grown six-fold. Augusta State University of Georgia won last
year&#x2019;s team title, the first school outside the Southeastern
Conference to do so. The University of Georgia won the first two
titles, followed by Mississippi State in 2009.</p>
