For the second year in a row, Sara Bailey, a student at CSUMB, is
producing a CD featuring 20 bands and musicians. Most of them are
students and alumni. Bailey hopes to release the free CD to
students in the spring. Her longtime goal &#x2013; and senior capstone
project &#x2013; is to launch a CSUMB-based label that would record and
promote musicians in the CSU system.<br>
