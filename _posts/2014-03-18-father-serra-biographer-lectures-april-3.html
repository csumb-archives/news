author of <em>Journey to the Sun: Junipero Serra&#x2019;s Dream and the
Founding of California</em>, will make a presentation at CSU
Monterey Bay on April 3. The community is invited to this free
event.<br>
<br>
Combining biography, European history, knowledge of Catholic
doctrine and anthropology, <em>Journey to the Sun</em> shows how
one man changed the future of California and in so doing affected
the future of the nation.</p>
<p>His presentation will begin at 7 p.m. in the University Center
conference room on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Reservations are
requested, and can be made by calling 582-3890 or e-mailing

and raised in Los Angeles, and educated at Georgetown University
and the University of Alaska. He is the author of nine books,
including the collection of essays, <em>Angeleno Days,</em> which
Richard Rodriguez has called &#x201C;delightful and wise.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Currently he is directing the creation of the Center for
California Studies at Westmont College, where he teaches creative
nonfiction, the short story, the literature of California, and
Middle Eastern &#xE9;migr&#xE9; literature.</p>
<p>The presentation is sponsored by the CSUMB&#x2019;s Division of Social,
Behavioral and Global Studies.</p>
<p><em>Orfalea writes from his own spiritual heart and soars into
the realm of poetry. . . His drama never lags.</em><br>
