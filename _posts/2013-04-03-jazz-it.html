<h3>Annual Heritage Music Festival set for April 27&#xA0;</h3>
<p>The community is invited to an evening of jazz on the campus of
California State University, Monterey Bay as the annual Heritage
Music Festival returns on April 27.</p>
<p><img alt="John Santos" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/john_santos.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:319px">The concert
features John Santos and his sextet and the CSUMB Jazz Ensemble,
with special guest soloist Don Pendergrass on piano.<br>
<br>
Santos, a five-time Grammy nominee, is a San Francisco Bay area
mainstay, a musical anchor and outspoken ambassador of the city&#x2019;s
active Latin jazz scene. He is an exponent of Afro-Latin music
through innovative use of traditional forms and instruments with
contemporary music. The John Santos Sextet appeared at the Monterey
Bay Festival in 2011.<br>
<br>
Pendergrass, a pianist and vocalist and longtime member of the
Roger Eddy Band, has four appearances at the Monterey Jazz Festival
to his credit. He is a stalwart of the local jazz scene.<br>
<br>
The concert is sponsored by CSUMB&#x2019;s Music and Performing Arts
Department, College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and
the university&#x2019;s Special Event Fund.</p>
<p>The free concert will be held from 7 to 10 p.m. in the Black Box
Cabaret, located on Fourth Street near the intersection of Gen. Jim
Moore Boulevard and Inter-Garrison Road.<br>
<br>
While the concert is free, a parking permit must be purchased from
a nearby dispenser. <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">Driving directions and a campus map are available
