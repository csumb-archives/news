The late-summer serenity of an emply college campus is missing from
CSU-Monterey Bay these days. While students attended orientation
for the first day of school, which starts Aug. 28, demolition
equipment shredded and ripped up old and abandoned military
buildings. The steel jaws of the destruction equipment have razed
30 buildings in the past couple of weeks to make room for a variety
of new campus projects, including a library and athletic
fields.<br>
