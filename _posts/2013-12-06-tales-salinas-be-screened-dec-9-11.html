<p>For years, Professor Rina Benmayor&#x2019;s students at CSU Monterey
Bay have worked to preserve memories of the residents of
Salinas.</p>
<p>Students in her <a href="http://hcom.csumb.edu/oral-history" rel="nofollow">Oral History and Community Memory</a> service
learning classes have designed,&#xA0;conducted and archived oral
histories focused on life stories and Chinatown memories of members
of the Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Latino communities. They
have also recorded memories of Salinas residents during key moments
of 20th century history.</p>
<p>The work continued this semester with two projects that will be
screened for the public, free of charge.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., Dec. 9, interviews with homeless people and service
providers who work with them will be screened at the Republic Cafe.
They talked about the future of Chinatown and about the caf&#xE9; as a
cultural center and museum.<br>
<br>
At 2 p.m., Dec. 11, excerpts of seven video interviews will be
screened at the National Steinbeck Center. The interviews are
intended to document and preserve residents&#x2019; memories of coming to
Salinas and the impact of World War II on individuals and the
community. The stories deal with native culture, the Alisal, the
USO and Main Street. Reservations are requested and can be made by
contacting Elizabeth Welden-Smith at <a href="mailto:Elizabeth@steinbeck.org">Elizabeth@steinbeck.org</a> or
775-4728. The center is located at One Main St., Salinas.</p>
