<em><strong>President Harrison joins nine CSUMB students and staff
who were recognized Feb. 20 for their outreach and tutoring service
at Greater Victory Temple in Seaside.</strong></em></p>
<p>Parishioners at three local churches got more than a sermon on
Feb. 20. They got a pitch for the value of a college education &#x2014;
straight from the pulpit.</p>
<p>President Dianne Harrison, Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe and Vice
President for Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs visited churches in
Seaside and Pacific Grove as part of a California State
University<br>
program called Super Sunday.</p>
<p>Administrators across the CSU system fanned out to more than 100
black churches to spread the gospel of higher education and
encourage more African-Americans to attend college.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison reminded the congregation at Greater Victory Temple
in Seaside that CSUMB &#x201C;is your hometown university.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe visited Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in
Seaside, and Dr. Higgs spoke at the First Baptist Church of Pacific
Grove.</p>
