Agent Mike Yoder will visit California State University, Monterey
Bay for a talk on &#x201C;Child Molesters in Their Words: What Can We
Learn?,&#x201D; about his work in the area of forensic psychology and sex
offenders. A question-and-answer session will follow.</p>
<p>Yoder has worked for the FBI for 16 years; currently, he
provides guidance on areas of online sexual exploitation of
children, missing/abducted children, child pornography and
cyberbullying.</p>
<p>In addition to conducting case consultations on active and cold
cases for law enforcement agencies throughout the United States, he
also provides training and conducts research in those areas to gain
a deeper understanding of the behavior of offenders who commit
crimes against child victims.</p>
<p>Prior to his current assignment, he led the FBI&#x2019;s Safe Child
Task Force in Atlanta, and was the coordinator of a group of agents
and local police officers dedicated to investigating online child
sex offenders and those engaged in child pornography.</p>
<p>The 6 p.m. talk will be held in the University Center, located
on Sixth Avenue at B Street. It&#x2019;s free, but attendees are asked to
RSVP to Heather Wilde at 831-582-4332.</p>
<p>A parking permit must be purchased from a machine in the parking
lot. <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">Driving
