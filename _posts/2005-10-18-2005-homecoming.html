<p>CSUMB&apos;s first homecoming was a success by all measures.<br>
<br>
On Saturday night, Oct. 8, the stands at the Otter Sports Center
were filled with 400 current students as well as alumni who had
returned for the big game. They were treated to the volleyball
team&apos;s first home win as a member of the California Collegiate
Athletic Association, a 3-1 victory over CSU-Stanislaus.<br>
<br>
On Third Street, the 13 entries in the shopping-cart parade - the
CSUMB equivalent of floats - strutted their stuff before a panel of
judges, who named the Otter Bay Caf&#xE9;&apos;s entry the winner. A bonfire
and barbecue, as well as a mixer for alums, served to rally the
crowd before game time.<br>
<br>
And a student tradition has been established.<br></p>
