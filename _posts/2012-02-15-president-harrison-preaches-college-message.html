<p><strong>CSUMB reaches out to African American
community&#xA0;</strong><br>
<br>
Each February, Super Sunday sends California State University
officials including Chancellor Charles B. Reed, trustees, and
campus presidents to African American churches throughout
California &#x2014; where they preach the power of college
preparation.</p>
<p>As part of the effort, CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne
Harrison and Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe will visit churches in
Seaside.</p>
<p>On Feb. 19, President Harrison will address the congregation at
Greater Victory Temple while Provost Cruz-Uribe will visit New Hope
Baptist Church.<br>
<br>
Following the services, staff members from CSUMB and church
education advisers will provide information on the application and
admission process, including virtual tours through CSUMentor.edu,
the website that provides the tools to plan and apply to a CSU
campus.<br>
<br>
Copies of the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/college/" rel="nofollow">How to Get to College</a>&#xA0;poster &#x2013; a practical
guide about how to prepare for college &#x2013; will be distributed. The
guide, available in several languages, in print and electronic
form, provides the list of classes that students need to take from
sixth grade to 12th grade to qualify for admission to the CSU. It
also provides tips for parents and mentors to help students
succeed.<br>
<br>
Aimed at improving college access and graduation rates among
African Americans, Super Sunday provides families with a wealth of
information about how to get to college and the value and
importance of a college degree. A recent report indicates that
African American males who do well in college had parents that set
high expectations for them and participated in programs that helped
them make the transition to college. Family involvement and
programs like Super Sunday contribute to college success in the
African American community.<br>
<br>
Now in its seventh year, Super Sunday has expanded to include more
than 100 churches throughout the state.<br>
