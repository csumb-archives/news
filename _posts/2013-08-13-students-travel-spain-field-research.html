<p>Six CSU Monterey Bay students spent part of their summer
learning how to conduct oral history interviews in a rural
community in Spain.</p>

Timothy Davis, A.J. Cibulsky, Karina Gomez, Megan Thomas and Susan
Dyar took part in the ethnographic field research school sponsored
by the <a href="http://sbgs.csumb.edu/social-behavioral-sciences-major" rel="nofollow">Division of Social and Behavioral Sciences.</a><br>
<br>
During June, the students and Dr. Juan Gutierrez, the program
director, traveled to Bo&#xF1;ar in the province of Le&#xF3;n, in
northwestern Spain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a town I never would have visited, yet loved more than
the destination spots we visited,&#x201D; Thomas said.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Gutierrez, the program has two goals: to give
students experience in ethnographic field research methods, and to
make a contribution to the region by generating knowledge and
appreciation for the cultural legacy of the area.</p>
<p>They collected and analyzed information, and visited
anthropological, historical and cultural sites, medieval locations
and cathedrals of northern Spain, and contemporary landmarks such
as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.</p>

collaborated with researchers associated with La Alcordanza, an
organization that studies and promotes the culture, traditions and
oral history of communities of northwestern Spain.</p>
<p>Professors from the Department of Contemporary History at the
University of the Basque Country extended support to the group. And
anthropologists from the University of Leon invited them to tour
the campus and explore ways for the two universities to collaborate
in various disciplines, especially social sciences, biology and
Spanish.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are proud to make CSUMB present in this part of the world
and of the very positive impact that the presence of the group is
having in the communities we visited,&#x201D; Dr. Gutierrez said.</p>
<p>The trip had a positive impact on the students as well.</p>
<p>Said Thomas: &#x201C;I learned to define my life on more substantial
grounds. Not by my income . . . , but by the relationships I have
with others.&#x201D;</p>
