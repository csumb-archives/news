<p>Kinesiology professor Kent Adams was honored by the National
Strength and Conditioning Association at its annual conference in
July.</p>
<p>At the meeting in Orlando, Fla., Dr. Adams was given the
editorial excellence award in recognition of his work on the
group&apos;s publication, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning
Research. He serves as associate editor of the publication,
primarily reviewing articles.</p>
<p>The NSCA is a nonprofit educational association that serves a
membership of 30,000 in 52 countries. Drawing on its network of
members such as Dr. Adams, it develops and presents the most
advanced information regarding strength training and conditioning
practices, injury prevention and research findings. It provides a
bridge between the scientist in the laboratory and the practitioner
in the field.</p>
<p>Dr. Adams, who earned a Ph.D. at Oregon State University, came
to CSUMB from the University of Louisville in 2005.</p>
<p>His research covers the lifespan &#x2013; everything from childhood
obesity to osteoporosis in the elderly.</p>
