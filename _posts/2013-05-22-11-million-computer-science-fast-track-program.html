<h3>Collaboration between CSUMB, Hartnell to start in fall</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay and Hartnell College have received a grant of
$1.1 million to support their new three-year degree program in
Computer Science and Information Technology.</p>
<p><img alt="NSF Acting Director Cora Marrett and President Eduardo Ochoa" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/pres._ochoa_for_web.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:243px">The university and
Hartnell have partnered to create a program called CSIT-in-3. The
two schools have worked closely on the program&#x2019;s design and
implementation and will collaborate on instruction, mentoring and
advising. It will start in the fall with approximately 30
students.</p>
<p>They will go through the program in groups, or cohorts, from
enrollment to graduation, following a pre-determined series of
courses. Along the way, they will receive academic support and
career development through workshops and internships. The students
will graduate in just three years and be ready to compete for
in-demand opportunities in the high-tech job market and in graduate
school.<br>
<br>
The grant, to be distributed over five years, is the result of a
partnership among the National Science Foundation, Intel and
General Electric. The project is called &#x201C;Graduate 10K+&#x201D; and its
goal is to increase the annual number of graduates in computer
science and engineering by 10,000.</p>
<p>The grant money will be used to hire a staff member to guide,
monitor, and support students&apos; academic progress as they move
through the program. It will also pay for a summer program to
enhance students&#x2019; academic skills, field trips and other support
programs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are building a new model for computer science education,&#x201D;
said Dr. Sathya Narayanan, director of the Computer Science and
Information Technology program at CSUMB. &#x201C;We are going beyond the
boundaries of institutions, courses and semesters to build a
program around the student cohorts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Joe Welch, lead program faculty member at Hartnell, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re
bringing in students who have traditionally been underrepresented
in computer science and information technology, and providing all
the support they need to succeed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The grant is the second major gift to the program. The Matsui
Foundation has committed to providing $30,000 over three years to
each of 23 students.</p>
<p>Under Graduate 10K+, a total of $10 million was awarded to nine
colleges and universities, including Cornell, Syracuse, University
of Texas and a collaboration between the University of Washington
and Washington State University.</p>
