<h3>A multimedia investigation into musical tunings</h3>
<p>Machine Project, a Los Angeles-based arts organization, will
visit CSU Monterey Bay for two public events Wednesday and
Thursday, Feb. 15 and 16, sponsored by the Teledramatic Arts and
Technology Department and the Monterey Bay Film Society.</p>
<p><img alt="Chris Kallmyer of L.A.-based Machine Project" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/headshot_by_alex_stephens_.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:200px">On Thursday at 6:30
p.m., writer Colin Dickey, artist Nicole Antebi and musician Chris
Kallmyer will explore a bit of musical history and the controversy
it has generated.</p>
<p>In overlapping performances, they will explore the difference
between two rival pitches &#x2013; 440 Hz and 432 Hz. Sound and music
consist of vibrations; the more vibrations per second, the higher
the pitch. The unit for measuring this is the Hertz, abbreviated
Hz.</p>
<p>The natural &#x201C;keynote&#x201D; in the universe is 432 Hz; 440 Hz is the
standard used today. Dickey will trace the history of the war for
correct musical tuning, a debate that has raged for two centuries
and has involved the French government, the British Broadcasting
Corp., and Joseph Goebbels, among others.</p>
<p>Antebi will accompany the talk with a two-channel video
&#x201C;tinkering&#x201D; with the shape of sound while Kallmyer creates
pitch-altered recordings of Wagner, sine tones and live
instruments.</p>
<p>On Wednesday at 7 p.m., Kallmyer will give a talk about Machine
Project, its work and approach to sound programming.</p>
<p>Both presentations will be held in the TAT Studio on Sixth
Avenue adjacent to the World Theater. Both are free, supported by
the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program in partnership with
the Monterey County Office of Education.</p>
