<h3>&#x2028;Submission deadline April 27 for Teen Film Festival</h3>
<p>Young filmmakers eager to see their work on a screen bigger than
YouTube will get the opportunity this fall, when CSU Monterey Bay
holds its fourth annual Teen Film Festival.</p>

Arts and Technology Department is accepting applications for the
festival, which will be held at CSUMB&apos;s World Theater on Sept. 29.
The deadline to apply is April 27.<br>
<br>
Filmmakers between 13 and 19 years old are invited to submit films
and videos up to five minutes in length. Entries may be in English
or Spanish and there is no entry fee. Entries may be submitted

<br>
TAT students will organize the event and handle the judging,
according to Professor Enid Baxter Blader.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&apos;s an educational experience for our students, who want to go
out in the world and have their films screened in film festivals. A
great way to understand that process is to curate a film festival,&quot;
Blader said.<br>
<br>
CSUMB also hopes the festival will serve as a way to interest local
teens who might not have considered going to college. By inviting
them to campus and showing them what the university offers, they
may consider enrolling.<br>
<br>
While local teenagers are encouraged to enter the competition, it&apos;s
also open to teenagers from around the world.<br>
<br>
<img alt="April 27 is the application deadline" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/filmmaking.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:181px">Last year&apos;s event
drew more than 200 entries with films submitted from Afghanistan,
South Africa, Venezuela, Salinas, Soledad and Los Angeles. Close to
400 people attended the festival, making it the most attended event
in three years. Teen filmmakers and their families from all over
California, as well as community members, came to enjoy the
show.<br>
<br>
The Monterey Bay Film Festival will also feature three programs
curated by Mike Plante. Plante is an associate programmer of the
Sundance Film Festival, and curates many other festivals
internationally. This will be his third year as the programmer of
the Monterey Bay Film Festival.</p>
