<h3>Grant allows undergrads to get first-hand experience</h3>
<p><img alt="A NSF grant will provide for summer research experiences at CSUMB" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/reu_story_for_web_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:500px; height:234px">One of CSU Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s selling points is its proximity to the bay. Students enjoy
the recreational activities associated with it; they can also work
with faculty members and scientists on research projects tied to
it.<br>
<br>
Those research opportunities have just expanded, thanks to a
program funded by the National Science Foundation and based at
CSUMB.<br>
<br>
As of this summer, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) in
ocean science will be available to students from all over the
country.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Dr. Corey Garza, a professor in CSUMB&apos;s Division of Science and
Environmental Policy, is the program director.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
The 10-week program will allow 11 students to get paid while
working with faculty and scientists on campus and at the Elkhorn
Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Stanford&#x2019;s Hopkins
Marine Station, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss
Landing Marine Labs and the Naval Postgraduate School.<br>
<br>
The program will give students hands-on research experience in
oceanography, marine biology and ecology, ocean engineering and
marine geology. They will work closely with university professors
and scientists, hear lectures by experts, collaborate on research
and develop oral presentations based on their area of
interest.<br>
<br>
The long-term goal is to train the next generation of professional
scientists.<br>
<br>
CSUMB becomes one of only 32 ocean science REUs in the country &#x2013;
and the only one in the CSU system. Other sites include Duke
University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution.<br>
<br>
A stipend and help with travel and housing expenses will be
provided. <a href="http://reu.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">More
