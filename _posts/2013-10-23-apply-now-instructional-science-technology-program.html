<h3>Open house scheduled for Oct. 29 at CSUMB</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to
learn more about the master&#x2019;s degree program in <a href="http://csumb.edu/mist" rel="nofollow">Instructional Science and
Technology</a> at an open house on Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The event will be held from 4:30 to 6 p.m. in the Alumni and
Visitors Center on Gen. Jim Moore&#xA0;<img alt="MIST prepares people for positions in education and training" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mist_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:200px">Boulevard. Several
current students and graduates of the program will share their
experience and how they are applying the skills they acquired to
their current work.</p>
<p>The 16-month program will start in the fall of 2014. Application
deadline is March 15.</p>
<p>The Master&#x2019;s in Instructional Science and Technology program
prepares students for positions in the fast-changing fields of
modern education and training. The hybrid learning experience &#x2013;
which integrates several days on campus at the beginning of each
semester with online classes &#x2013; enables graduates to advance in
their current careers and will position them to assume leadership
roles in education and training.</p>
<p>Successful educators and e-learning developers in the
knowledge-based, global economy require command of all the
technological tools and methodologies available to them; the MIST
program is designed to provide students with those skills.</p>
<p>More information about the MIST program is available <a href="http://csumb.edu/mist" rel="nofollow">here</a>, by calling the
School of Information Technology and Communication Design at
