<p>Two CSU Monterey Bay students are about to get an up-close look
at the inner workings of government.</p>

Jesse Reyes and Dahlia Ezekwonna will travel to Washington,
D.C.,where they will spend the semester working as interns and
earning academic credit.</p>
<p>Reyes is a senior majoring in environmental studies. He is
passionate about conservation and committed to keeping green spaces
accessible to young people.</p>
<p>He will work with the Department of the Interior&#x2019;s Office of
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. While in D.C., he also
hopes to learn how non-profit environmental organizations
operate.</p>
<p>Ezekwonna is a global studies major from Grenoble, France. She
is interested in international affairs, and hopes to work at an
embassy during her internship since she aspires to a career in
diplomacy.</p>
<p>Both students received $5,000 scholarships from the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company, and $2,500 from CSUMB to help with the
costs. The Met Life scholarships became available as part of the
<a href="../../../2013/jul/29/another-service-learning-award-csumb.html" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Civic Engagement Award</a> the
university&apos;s <a href="http://service.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Service Learning</a> program won last
year.&#xA0;<img alt="Dahlia Ezekwonna" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/dahlia.jpg" style="width:250px; height:167px; float:left"></p>
<p>The Washington Center arranges internships for approximately 300
students each semester. The students work 35 to 40 hours a week and
take academic courses, including a leadership forum, at the
center.</p>
