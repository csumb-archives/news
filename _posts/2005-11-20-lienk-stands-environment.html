Environmentalist Laura Lee Lienk, who recently received the Rising
Leaf Watershed Arts Hero Award for restoration, lives in a home
that&apos;s a blast from the past. She has a long drive back home each
day from CSU-Monterey Bay, where she co-directs the Watershed
Institute, coordinates community partnerships for the Service
Learning Institute there and coordinates the Watershed Institute&apos;s
community-based habitat restoration programs throughout the
county.<br>
