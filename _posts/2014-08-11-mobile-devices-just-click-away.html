<p>As students prepare to return to campus, they don&apos;t have to
worry about buying the latest technology. They can rent it by the
week, month or semester at CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s TechRent store.</p>
<p>This fall, the store is back for its fifth year, offering
students an affordable alternative to costly purchases.</p>
<p>Since the spring of 2010, TechRent has saved students more than
$616,000 in equipment purchase costs and generated nearly $66,000
in rental fees. That money supports the store&apos;s operations and
covers the cost of purchasing additional technology.</p>
<p>The store operates virtually, meaning that students are able to
learn about and place orders for products, including clickers,
laptops &#x2013; the most requested item &#x2013; flip cams, iPads, calculators,
cameras and pocket projectors, online, and pick them up at the
TechRent desk located in the Media Learning Center outside Room 111
or in the west lobby of the building.</p>
<p>Other items in the store&apos;s inventory include Kodak cams, Bamboo
touch pads and smart pens. Since the program&apos;s inception, 2,109
items have been rented.</p>
<p>Quantity and variety of items for rent have continued to expand
in response to campus needs. Faculty members may borrow equipment
for a few weeks to experiment with implementation into their
courses. Rentals are also available to them and to staff
members.</p>
<p>The project was launched with funding from the U.S. Department
of Education.&#xA0;Arlene Krebs, director of CSUMB&#x2019;s Wireless
Education and Technology Center, is the force behind TechRent. She
responded to a call for textbook rental grant applications from the
Education Department&#x2019;s Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary
Education with her equipment rental idea.</p>
<p>CSUMB was awarded just under $300,000 in the fall of 2009; the
virtual store was up and running three months later.</p>
<p>The TechRent team includes Krebs and Jonathan Baptista, who
serves as store manager and technical support guru. They ensure
that all technologies are accessible for people with learning and
physical disabilities.<br>
<br>
&quot;We&apos;ve established a unique service for our campus community,&quot;
Krebs said, &quot;a campus resource that has become as important as the
library and the bookstore.&quot;</p>
