Nearly 200 high school students gathered at California State
University, Monterey Bay, to learn about teamwork and community
involvement at an innovative new service fair. CSUMB, which
incorporates service learning into its own program, is helping
connect students with volunteer opportunities while gaining a
greater understanding of service itself.<br>
