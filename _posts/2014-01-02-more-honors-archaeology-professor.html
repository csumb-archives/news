annual meeting of the California Mission Studies Association
(CMSA). The meeting will be held Feb. 14-16 at Mission San Antonio
de Padua and Paso Robles.</p>
<p>An expert on many aspects of mission and California history, Dr.
Mendoza will speak to the conference theme of &quot;Ranchos y Vaqueros:
Missions and Mission Land After Secularization.&quot; His presentation
will address the transformation of the missions and mission lands
through the course of the 19th century.</p>
<p>&quot;We are honored to have Dr. Mendoza as part of our opening day
activities. His talks have been highlights of our previous
conferences, and we are pleased to be able to showcase his research
as part of Friday&apos;s keynote address,&#x201D; association president David
A. Bolton said.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendoza has also been nominated for the CMSA&#x2019;s prestigious
Norman Neureburg Award.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&apos;m honored to have been nominated as Norman Neureburg was the
art historian and Missions specialist who worked closely and
diligently with J. Paul Getty to design and see through the
construction of the Getty Center in Los Angeles, and the Getty
Villa in Santa Monica,&#x201D; Dr. Mendoza said.</p>
<p>The award recognizes outstanding contributions to the study and
preservation of California&apos;s missions, presidios, pueblos and
ranchos.&#xA0;<br>
