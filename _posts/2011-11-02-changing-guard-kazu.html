<p>Mik Benedek has been promoted to the position of general manager
at KAZU 90.3, effective Aug. 1.</p>
<p><img alt="Mik Benedek" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/65/attachments/news/images/mik_new_headshot.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:275px">Benedek, a 30-year
veteran of local broadcasting, has been with the station since 2005
as director of underwriting.</p>
<p>Prior to joining KAZU, the public radio station licensed to the
University Corporation of CSU Monterey Bay, Benedek owned and
operated local radio stations KMBY in the late 1990s and KHIP in
the late 1980s. A resident of Aptos, he holds a bachelor of fine
arts degree in film and television from New York University.</p>
<p>&quot;In Mik Benedek, KAZU has an experienced broadcaster who can
maintain the station&apos;s strong momentum as the signature source of
NPR programming for the Monterey Bay area,&quot; CSUMB President Dianne
Harrison said.</p>
<p>Benedek replaces Doug McKnight, who is retiring at the end of
July. McKnight joined the station in 2004 as assistant general
manager and development director, then moved into the general
manager position in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m grateful for the opportunity to continue building a great
radio station that serves the Monterey Bay area,&quot; Benedek said.</p>
