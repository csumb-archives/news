<p>Alexis wants to get off painkillers. Mariette jumps at loud
noises. BriGette won&apos;t leave her home. Lashonna does not have one.
Sue and Alicia served together and survived an IED explosion. A new
documentary, &#x201C;SERVICE: When Women Come Marching Home&#x201D; by Marcia
Rock and Patricia Lee Stotter, follows these women over a two-year
period as they struggle to make the transition from active duty in
Iraq and Afghanistan to civilian life.</p>
<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/service_image_1.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:189px">In honor of Armed
Forces Week, CSU Monterey Bay will hold a free community screening
and a question-and-answer session with filmmaker Rock, at 7 p.m.,
May 22, at the World Theater on the university campus. The Arts
Council for Monterey County is co-sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>Women make up 14 percent of today&apos;s military. That number is
expected to double in 10 years. SERVICE portrays the courage of
these women, the horrific traumas they face, the inadequate care
they often receive on return, and the accomplishments &#x2013; large and
small &#x2013; they work mightily to achieve. Through compelling
portraits, the film shows them wrestling with prosthetics,
homelessness, post-traumatic stress and its insidious catalyst,
military sexual trauma.</p>
<p>The film is also about the resourcefulness of these women, and
how they created a supportive network through social media.<br>
<br>
The nation has a new military force. The veterans shown in the film
represent the first wave of mothers, daughters and sisters
returning home. The power of the documentary is in the intimacy it
establishes with them, speaking with them in their kitchens and
bathrooms, back yards, classrooms, therapy sessions and super
markets. The film aims to wake up a sleeping civilian
population.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here.</a>&#xA0;For disability

<p><em>Without doubt, the most powerful film I&#x2019;ve seen about women
veterans. It tears you to pieces to watch it and restores your soul
. . . all at the same time. It&#x2019;s a documentary about hope. It&#x2019;s the
best film you haven&#x2019;t seen yet. Tell everyone you know about
it.</em><br>
