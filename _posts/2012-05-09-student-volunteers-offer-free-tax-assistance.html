<p class="small"><strong>UPDATE (May 2012):&#xA0;</strong>The VITA
program was named the winner of this year&apos;s Penn Partnership Award.
The annual award&#xA0;honors partners who make service learning
possible and powerful. Named after Marian Penn, founding director
of the Service Learning Institute, the Penn Partnership Award
recognizes community partners and faculty who have demonstrated
exceptional commitment, communication and success in strengthening
communities through service learning programs. This year&apos;s faculty
honorees are Susan Morse and Cathy Ku of CSUMB&apos;s School of
Business.&#xA0;</p>
<h3>Help available on campus and in the community</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay student volunteers from the School of Business
have provided free income tax preparation for the public on some
Saturdays in March at the university.<br>
<br>
The last session will be held on March 24 from 9 a.m. to noon in
Room 115 of Valley Hall. For driving directions and a campus map,

<p>Families and individuals who earned less than $50,000 in 2011
are eligible. Filers must bring photo identification, Social
Security card or ITIN card for workers and all family members,
their W-2 and 1099 forms and a copy of last year&#x2019;s return. It&apos;s not
necessary to make an appointment.</p>
<p>Tax forms will be filed electronically. If a refund is due, it
will be deposited in the taxpayer&apos;s account in approximately 10
days.<br>
<br>
The service is part of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)
program, sponsored by United Way Monterey County. It&#x2019;s being
offered at 10 county locations in addition to CSUMB.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Student volunteers are working at most of those sites.&#xA0;All
volunteers have completed a training course and have been certified
by the IRS.</p>
<p>Jennifer Warner, an aspiring accountant who works at a location
in Salinas, has participated in the program for the past two years.
She volunteers to gain professional skills and experience, and to
help families who really need every penny. &#x201C;There are a lot of
unclaimed credits in the system, so we try to help families get
every credit they are eligible for. The people are very grateful,&#x201D;
Warner said. &#xA0;</p>
<p><img alt="Business students will prepare taxes for those who qualify" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/income_tax_1.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:250px">According to Dr.
Cathy Ku, professor of accounting at CSUMB, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a good service
learning opportunity for students. The first year &#x2013; 2010 &#x2013; five
students participated. Last year, 20 students volunteered at eight
locations in the county and helped families claim $1 million in
refunds.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This year, the number of volunteers has grown to 50, and they
provide services at nine sites.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
While all 50 students passed the required basic certification
course, &#x201C;10 students and I passed the intermediate level course.
That&#x2019;s why we were able to set up a VITA site at CSUMB,&#x201D; Dr. Ku
said.<br>
<br>
The United Way emphasizes that the program is free to those who
qualify.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no charge for the tax preparation, no charge for direct
deposit to the taxpayer&#x2019;s bank account and no hidden fees,&#x201D; said
Fatima Dias, director of marketing and communication for United
Way.</p>
