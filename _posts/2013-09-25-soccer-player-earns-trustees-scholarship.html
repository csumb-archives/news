Bay sophomore Regan Porteous has been selected to receive a
<a href="http://www.calstate.edu/foundation/hearst/" rel="nofollow">CSU Trustees&#x2019; Award for Outstanding Achievement.</a> She
and the other award winners were honored on Sept. 24 at the CSU
board meeting in Long Beach.</p>
<p>The award is among the highest student distinctions in the CSU
and is accompanied by a scholarship. Awardees must demonstrate
superior academic performance, personal accomplishments, community
service and financial need. Many of the honorees have prevailed in
the face of disability, language and cultural barriers, intense
personal loss or homelessness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSU trustees&#x2019; scholars have defied the odds, rising above
circumstance to become leaders among their classmates and
exemplifying the CSU mission of access to a quality higher
education,&#x201D; said Chancellor Timothy White.</p>
<p>Regan&#x2019;s father was sentenced to life in prison when she was an
infant. Much of her childhood was&#xA0;<img alt="Regan plays on the CSUMB soccer team" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/soccer_shot_of_regan_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:375px">spent behind barbed
wire and guard towers as she and her family visited him nearly
every Sunday. She faced the obstacle of not having a father
involved in her daily life; she also encountered low expectations
of children in her circumstances.</p>
<p>She overcame it all, set goals for herself and is now an
accomplished and poised woman, a dean&#x2019;s list student majoring in
psychology, and a varsity athlete.</p>
<p>At the request of a district attorney in her hometown of Lodi,
she has shared her story with students in continuation schools to
help them cope with similar circumstances.</p>
<p>She currently volunteers for the university&apos;s Student-Athlete
Advisory Committee, which includes participating in youth clinics,
reading to elementary school children, and collecting food for the
Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Regan plans to earn an advanced degree so she
can help children in circumstances similar to those she experienced
as a child.</p>
<p>More than 437,000 students attend the 23 campuses of the CSU
system. Only one student from each campus is honored with the
Trustees&#x2019; Award. The program began nearly three decades ago with
scholarships endowed by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. In
1999, the generosity of current and emeritus CSU trustees allowed
the program to expand.&#xA0;</p>
