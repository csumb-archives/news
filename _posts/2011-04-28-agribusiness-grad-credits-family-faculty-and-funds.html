<p>Martin Vargas-Garcia, a 2009 graduate, represented alumni as a
featured speaker at the Feb. 26 Have a Heart for Students Dinner
and Auction, making the connection between a scholarship he
received at CSUMB and his career success.</p>
<p>Vargas-Garcia double-majored in Business Administration and
Visual &amp; Public Art and was the first in his family to earn a
degree, after transferring from Hartnell College in Salinas. Before
attending college, he worked in the fields of the Salinas Valley,
harvesting vegetables.</p>
<p>For almost two years, he has worked at Sakata Seed America Inc.
in Morgan Hill, the company&#x2019;s North and South American
headquarters. His current title is priming operations manager, and
he is a serious photographer in his spare time.</p>
<p>Vargas-Garcia grew up in Salinas, where he now lives with his
wife, Juanita, and their two children &#x2013; daughter, Itzel, 9, and
son, Diego, 5.</p>
<p>He credits his success in the workplace to the support of his
family and the help and encouragement<br>
he received from professors. His $1,000 agribusiness scholarship
also made a big difference, he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That scholarship paid for my school supplies and allowed me to
focus full-time on my studies at a critical time,&#x201D; said
Vargas-Garcia, who also received the Alumni Vision Award in his
senior year.</p>
