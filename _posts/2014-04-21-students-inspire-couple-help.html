<h3>Two UROCers get research support</h3>
<p>Two more CSU Monterey Bay students have benefitted from the
generosity of Barbara Baldock and Phillip Butler.</p>
<p>The Monterey residents have sponsored students through CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a> since
2010-11.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We see it as helping give a little bit of a push to students on
their way to a higher-level degree,&#x201D; Dr. Butler told the
university&#x2019;s magazine several years ago.</p>
<p>This year&#x2019;s recipients of the Baldock-Butler awards are Breanna
Orozco (kinesiology) and Lilyana Gross (math). They were selected
based on their academic achievements, research accomplishments,
financial need, graduate school aspirations and a commitment to
serve the community.</p>
<p>Each student will receive $4,000 to support her research and
graduate school application activities.</p>

(right) is a McNair Scholar and the first in her family to attend
college. She spent last summer working at the University of
Southern California&#x2019;s Clinical Exercise Research Center. She&#x2019;ll
return to USC this summer to continue her exercise intervention
research. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. in biokinesiology.</p>
<p>She has worked with her mentor, Dr. Lisa Leininger, to develop a
worksite wellness program for CSUMB employees; the program doubled
as a research study to determine if the program increased physical
activity and decreased stress in employees. The work has been
accepted for publication in the Journal of Fitness Research.</p>
<p><img alt="Lilyana Gross" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/lilyana_for_web.jpg" style="width:251px; height:239px; float:left">Gross, a junior,
intends to pursue a doctoral program in applied mathematics and
statistics with applications to biology and public health. Her
research interests include stochastic modeling, epidemiology and
biostatistics methods in clinical trials.</p>
<p>She spent last summer at North Carolina State University,
conducting research on the spread of illicit drugs by modeling
methamphetamine use as a disease moving through the population.
This summer, she will conduct research in HIV/AIDS clinical trials
at the Harvard School of Public Health&#x2019;s Department of
Biostatistics.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler is a graduate of the Naval Academy, was a fighter
pilot for many years and spent eight years as a POW in North
Vietnam. After earning a Ph.D. in sociology from UC San Diego in
1981, he was a professor of management at the Naval Postgraduate
School before starting a management consulting firm. Baldock, a
former flight attendant, joined him as marketing director, and they
married 33 years ago.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We feel these people are going to be leaders, and they&#x2019;re going
to make a difference,&#x201D; Baldock said of the UROC students. &#x201C;That
really resonates with both of us.&#x201D;</p>
