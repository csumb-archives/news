<h3>CSUMB&#x2019;s Return of the Natives&#x2019; annual event Jan. 19</h3>
<p><img alt="White pelican" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/white_pelican_detail_1.jpg" style="float:right; width:225px; height:169px">Volunteers will be
out at 7 a.m. Saturday, Jan. 19, looking for hawks, geese, ducks,
wrens and a variety of other species at the Watershed Institute&#x2019;s
eighth annual winter bird count at Upper Carr Lake in Salinas.
Everyone is welcome to help during the three-hour count.<br>
<br>
The lake, on East Laurel Drive between Constitution Boulevard and
Sanborn Road, is a resting stop for migratory birds. In 2012,
volunteers from CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Return of the Natives project
counted approximately 70 species, including American coots,
yellow-rumped warblers, a few egrets and several varieties of
hawks.<br>
<br>
Participants will be provided with a data sheet on the birds of
Monterey County, published by the Monterey Peninsula Audubon
Society, and a pair of binoculars.<br>
<br>
After the bird count, volunteers are invited to help clean up the
lake and do some planting from 10 a.m. to noon. Tools, water and
snacks will be provided.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are happy to see that this growing environment fosters an
accommodating habitat for birds &#x2013; which emphasizes the purpose of
the second half of the morning &#x2013; to keep Upper Carr Lake clean and
healthy to keep the birds coming back,&#x201D; said Amanda Magallanes,
volunteer coordinator with Return of the Natives Restoration
Education Project.<br>
<br>
The local bird survey is one of 2,100 similar counts over the last
month. As many as 55,000 National Audubon Society volunteers from
Guam to Labrador and from Alaska to Chile slog through the woods,
find their way up mountains or look out their kitchen windows for
the squawking, quacking and tweeting flocks.<br>
<br>
Return of the Natives will submit the information it gathers to
California eBird, the Audubon Society&#x2019;s online database.<br>
