<h3>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute&#xA0;brings folks back to
school</h3>
<p>What do Woody Allen, nature photography and spy novels have in
common?</p>
<p><img alt="OLLI spring 2014 catalog cover" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/olli_spring-2014_275x356.jpg" style="float:left; width:275px; height:356px">They are among the
classes that will be offered this semester through the Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI &#x2013; at California State
University, Monterey Bay specifically for those 50 and better.</p>
<p>OLLI at CSU Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher
Foundation, is part of a national network that recognizes learning
and exploration have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a
fresh look at themselves, their world, and the possibilities that
await them.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are a variety of writing classes
including Food Writing: The Ultimate Delicacy; an examination of
three novels by Haruki Murakami; birds of the Central Coast; and
coral reefs of Indonesia.</p>
<p>New this year are classes on coastal plants and animals and
Monterey&#x2019;s spring wildflowers, both taught by ecologist Nikki
Nedeff; a three-session course on the history of modern aviation,
taught by Don Porter, a contributor to Smithsonian Air &amp; Space
magazine; an introduction to science illustration; and a look at
the history of the Japanese tea ceremony.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a two-session
class that will provide an insider&#x2019;s view of the June ballot,
covering the major races and key initiatives that will impact
California for years to come. Also returning is former Monterey
Peninsula College instructor Allston James, who will teach a class
on Shakespeare&#x2019;s Richard III and MacBeth.</p>
<p>Another popular returning instructor is Todd Samra, whose
four-session course will focus on the work of French Impressionist
composers Debussy, Ravel and Faure.</p>
<p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can
sign up for an annual membership &#x2013; which includes tuition for 10
classes for $210, or five classes for $140. Memberships include
discounts on campus and other benefits.</p>
