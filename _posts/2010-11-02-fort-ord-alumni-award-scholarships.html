<p>The dozen students who were selected to receive scholarships
from the Fort Ord Alumni Association cover the spectrum of academic
majors available at Cal State Monterey Bay: human communication;
business; liberal studies; global studies; teledramatic arts and
technology; environmental science, technology and policy; health
and human services; marine science; kinesiology.</p>
<p>And they aspire to varied careers: sports journalist;
pharmacist; public relations practitioner; master chef; teacher;
filmmaker; environmental engineer; nurse; scientist; physical
therapist.</p>
<p>One plans to study abroad; two are members of the university&#x2019;s
athletic teams; some come from military families or have been on
active duty; all have served their communities in some way.</p>
<p>What the 12 students have in common is the ability to embrace
the opportunities that life offers.<br>
The awards, which were given at the association&#x2019;s annual luncheon
on Oct. 27, bring to 112 the total number of scholarships &#x2013; all in
the amount of $1,000 &#x2013; given by FOAA since its scholarship program
began.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Fort Ord Alumni Association was established in 1996 &#x2013; shortly
after the university opened its doors on a portion of the former
Army base &#x2013; to provide financial assistance to students and to
honor and preserve the heritage of Fort Ord and the contributions
of the soldiers, civilians and their families who lived and worked
there. Membership is open to anyone who wishes to join in these
efforts.<br>
<br>
This year, more than 140 scholarship applications were received.
Grade-point average, leadership, participation in extra-curricular
activities and volunteer work at school or in the local community
were considered in the evaluation process.<br>
