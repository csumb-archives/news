<h3>Class of 2014 dons regalia made from recycled bottles</h3>
<p>The gowns worn by CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s graduates will still be
black, but come commencement day on May 17, they&#x2019;ll also be
green.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Plastic bottles are used to make commencement gowns" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/plastic_bottles.jpeg" style="float:right; width:275px; height:367px">Herff Jones, the
company that supplies the earth-friendly gear, has created a line
of graduation regalia manufactured from Repreve, a fiber made of
recycled materials, including plastic bottles. It takes
approximately 29 bottles to make a gown, the company says.&#x2028;&#x2028;</p>
<p>The plastic bottles are chopped, ground, melted and reformulated
into chips that go through a proprietary process that produces
yarn. Every pound of yarn that goes into the fabric used in the
gowns saves one-half gallon of gasoline and produces half the CO2
emissions of the typical polyester manufacturing process, according
to the company.&#x2028;&#x2028;</p>
<p>The only part of the gown not made from recycled material is the
zipper.</p>
<p>Not only is this smart for the environment, but CSUMB
commencement coordinator Phyllis Grillo said the recycled gowns
look better than the non-recycled options.&#x2028;&#x2028;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They wrinkle less,&#x201D; Grillo said. &#x201C;And students appreciate the
&#x2018;green&#x2019; aspect.&#x201D;<br>
