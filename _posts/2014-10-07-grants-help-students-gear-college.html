<p>Middle school students in Monterey County will be better
equipped for college thanks to federal grants awarded to Cal State
Monterey Bay.</p>

allow 3,620 students to be served in San Ardo, San Lucas,
Greenfield, King City, Salinas and Seaside.</p>
<p>The grants, which amount to $2.1 million per year for six years,
with another $1.4 million in year seven, were awarded under the
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs &#x2013;
GEAR UP &#x2013; administered by the U.S Department of Education.</p>
<p>GEAR UP aims to increase the proportion of students from
low-income areas who are prepared for college. It provides academic
and financial aid advising, tutoring, college field trips and other
activities that help students prepare for and apply to college.</p>

begin working with seventh- and eighth-grade classes this year and
will provide services through their first year of college.</p>
<p>While CSUMB offers a variety of early outreach and support
programs for underserved students, this is the first GEAR UP grant
for the university.</p>

school climate, which leads to better student behavior and improved
academic performance. It emphasizes recognition and praise of
positive behavior as opposed to punishing students for bad
behavior.<br>
