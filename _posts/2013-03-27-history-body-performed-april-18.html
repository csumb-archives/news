<h3>Why are we afraid of the dark?</h3>
<p>Excerpts from &#x201C;A History of the Body,&#x201D; a new work by Aimee

<p>The production is part of the university&#x2019;s celebration of Asian
Pacific Islander American Heritage Month.</p>

Body,&#x201D; directed by Pamela Wu Kochiyama and co-produced by The
Pagbabalik Project and Third Root Productions, is about what
happens to two women who meet in a beauty salon. The play addresses
modern-day attitudes toward beauty and skin tone for Filipina women
and women of color, the global rise in the use of skin-whitening
products, and the historical events and stereotypes about people of
color perpetuated at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Following the performance, Suzara and writer/scholar Lisa Marie
Rollins will discuss what went into creating this provocative work.
Afterward, the audience will have the opportunity to talk with the
director and cast.</p>
<p>The production will take place at 7:30 p.m. in the World
Theater. The event is free, but visitors must purchase a $2 parking
permit. The theater is located on Sixth Avenue near B Street.

<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s Special Events Committee, Division of Humanities and
Communication, Otter Cross Cultural Center and the NAACP are
sponsors of the event.</p>
