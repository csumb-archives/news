<h3>An insider&#x2019;s look at Seattle&#x2019;s outsider poet</h3>
<p>The Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department at CSU Monterey
Bay will present a screening of &#x201C;I Am Secretly an Important Man&#x201D; at
the Osio Theater in Monterey on March 5.</p>
<p>The documentary film, directed by Peter Sillen, will be shown at
7 p.m.</p>

examines the life of subculture hero Steven Jesse Bernstein.
Bernstein, a songwriter, poet and performance artist, was a
literary rebel and vivid presence in Seattle&#x2019;s underground scene in
the 1970s and &#x2019;80s. Cited as the &#x201C;godfather of grunge,&#x201D; he opened
concerts for Nirvana and Soundgarden and recorded albums of songs
and poetry for Sub Pop Records.</p>
<p>The film&#x2019;s title comes from one of his poems, &#x201C;Come Out
Tonight.&#x201D; It became an inspiration and an anthem for the
grunge-rock movement.</p>
<p>Using video and audio clips of his subject, along with
interviews with the artist&#x2019;s family, friends and colleagues, and
powerful footage of the darker side of Seattle, Sillen shows the
poet&#x2019;s self-examination and what Bernstein called just plain &#x201C;doing
your job.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="Movie poster for " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/movie_poster.jpg" style="float:right; width:171px; height:253px">The director will
be on hand to introduce the film and to take questions from the
audience after the showing. A New York based documentary filmmaker,
Sillen is best known for his low-tech approach and sensitivity to
his subjects and their environment. He has screened his films at a
wide array of festivals and venues including the Sundance Film
Festival, Berlin Film Festival, South By Southwest, Slamdance, the
Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Academy of Music and San Francisco&#x2019;s
Castro Theater.</p>
<p>Mike Plante, an associate programmer of the Sundance Film
Festival who has worked with TAT for several years, selected the
film.</p>
<p>According to TAT department chair Enid Blader, &#x201C;Mike selected it
not only because it fits with the literary tradition of the
Monterey Bay area, but also to continue championing films that
might otherwise go unseen, and to support a filmmaker who is
telling a story in a distinct and stylish way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tickets can be purchased at the door at the regular Osio prices:
$9 for general admission, $6.25 for seniors, $6.75 for
students/military with ID.</p>
<p><br>
<em>Whether he&#x2019;s a grunge footnote, a beatnik wannabe, or a
beautiful, belated loser, the film allows you to decide.</em><br>
