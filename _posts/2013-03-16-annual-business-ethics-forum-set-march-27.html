wealthiest corporations, will be explored at the annual Ethics
Forum sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s schools of Business, and
Information&#xA0;<img alt="Business Ethics Forum will be held March 27" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/business-ethics.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:224px">Technology and

<p>How did Apple get so rich? Why do we love Apple and hate Exxon?
Is corporate social responsibility good business? In a contest
between stakeholders and shareholders, who wins?<br>
<br>
The forum&#x2019;s keynote speaker is Rich Jaroslovsky, an editor-at-large

Bloomberg News. He joined Bloomberg after a long career at The Wall
Street Journal, where he was White House correspondent, national
political editor and the founding managing editor of The Wall
Street Journal Online. He makes frequent appearances on National
Public Radio&#x2019;s &#x201C;Morning Edition&#x201D; program.</p>
<p>Jaroslovsky will talk about how and why Apple has grown so
dramatically in a short period of time, and discuss the
reverberations that kind of growth has on ethical issues and
corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>Panelists include Dr. Angie Tran, professor of political economy
at CSUMB and Fane Opperman, managing director, investments, of the
Opperman Financial Group of Wells Fargo Advisors of San Jose.
Jaroslovsky will also join the panel.<br>

Jeff Froshman, a lecturer in the university&#x2019;s School of Business
and a local CPA and certified financial planner, will moderate the
panel.</p>
