CSU Monterey Bay lecturer John Wineglass is an award-winning
composer and musician who has traveled the world since he was 11
years old.
<p>He says he owes it all to an opportunity afforded him as a
youngster growing up in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Without question, the D.C. Youth Orchestra changed my life,&#x201D;
Wineglass said.</p>
<p>When the youth orchestra asked him to compose a piece for its
50th anniversary celebration at the Kennedy Center in August, he
seized the opportunity. Despite the short notice &#x2013; he had only two
months to work on the five-minute piece &#x2013; he was eager to
contribute to the program.</p>
<p>A concert review in the Washington Post singled Wineglass out
for praise.</p>
<p>According to the Post&apos;s music critic, Cecelia Porter, the
conductor&#xA0;&#x201C;drew from the group iridescent colors in the
premiere of a beautifully crafted suite by DCYO alumnus John
Wineglass.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The composer was also the featured violinist for the piece, one
of 110 alumni orchestra members who performed that night.</p>
<p>Wineglass&#x2019; passion for music has also led him to develop
proficiency as a contemporary jazz and gospel pianist. He serves as
music director for Shoreline Community Church.</p>
