participating in United Way Monterey County&#x2019;s Stuff the Bus
campaign, a countywide drive to collect school supplies for
children whose families are not able to afford them.<br>
<br>
Donations can be dropped in the bin &#x2013; shaped like a tiny school bus
&#x2013; located in the Student Center.<br>
<br>
The third annual campaign gets under way on June 20 and will run
through July 30, when the supplies will be stuffed into backpacks
and distributed through the Monterey County Office of
Education.<br>
<br>
Monterey County has seen a steady growth in the number of homeless
children; in 2011-12, more than 5,100 homeless students where
attending school in the county. Add kids in foster care and those
from families in need, and the size of the problem becomes
apparent.<br>
<br>
Among the items needed are:</p>
<p>Backpacks (no solid red or blue), 3-ring binders, dividers,
binder paper, spiral notebooks, crayons, pencils, pens, rulers,
glue sticks, construction paper, pink erasers, yellow highlighters,
pocket dictionaries.<br>
