<p>Andrea Gilliland, a psychology major and certified pastry chef,
works for Sodexo in the Catering Department and the Otter Bay
Cafe.</p>
<p>During last year&#x2019;s Otter Orientation, she inquired about a
gluten-free meal for her mother. This inquiry, along with her
culinary experience, landed her a chef position for Sodexo while
she continues as a full-time student. Gilliland has since
introduced gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian and vegan options
for diners.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Working in the Catering Department has provided me with
challenges and also the ability to branch out in my creativity,&#x201D;
said the senior from San Luis Obispo. She also created menu items
for the Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction, the Business
Showcase Dinner, and this year&#x2019;s post-Commencement luncheon.</p>
<p>After graduation in spring 2011, she plans to cook her way
through school as she completes a Master of Social Work degree.</p>
