<p>Professor Yoshiko Saito-Abbott has been honored by her peers
with a lifetime achievement award.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Yoshiko Saito-Abbott" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/saito-abbott.jpg" style="width:310px; height:233px; float:left">At its annual
meeting in March, the California Language Teachers Association will
present her with its Hal Wingard Award. It recognizes an
individual&#x2019;s dedication and commitment to the language teaching
profession over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Dr. Saito-Abbott came to CSU Monterey Bay in 1996 as an
associate professor of Japanese. She is currently chair of the
School of World Languages and Cultures and site director for the
Monterey Bay Foreign Language Project.</p>
<p>She earned a Ph.D. in foreign language education at Ohio State
University.</p>
<p>Hal Wingard was a driving force in the development of
foreign-language education in California and a pioneer in
language-immersion programs. He died in 2009.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, the San Diego Union-Tribune said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;His legacy includes establishing the California Language
Teachers Association (CLTA) and promoting the idea that learning
others&#x2019; languages and cultures leads to better understanding.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The CLTA named an award for him and honored him with the first
Hal Wingard Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995, in recognition of
his dedication and service. Since then, the annual has been given
annually.</p>
