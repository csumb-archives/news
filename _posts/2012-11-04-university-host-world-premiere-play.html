<p>&#x201C;The Fisherman Ming Cho Yee and the Princess under the Sea,&#x201D; a
play written by Music and Performing Arts faculty member Will
Shephard, will have its first public performances at CSU Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s University Center in November.</p>

based on Monterey and Pacific Grove history and partially on a
classic folk tale, will be presented Nov. 9 and 10 at 7:30 p.m.,
and at a matinee performance Nov. 10 at 2 p.m. The University
Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street on the CSUMB
campus.</p>
<p>The play begins in a Chinese village by the sea at Point Alones
near Pacific Grove in the year 1894.</p>
<p>Persecuted socially, yet tolerated by the Anglo-European
majority as a local curiosity, the Chinese fisherman are only
permitted to fish for squid at night from their small fishing
boats, lit by lanterns.</p>
<p>The lead character, a fisherman named Ming Cho Yee, saves a
leatherback sea turtle from being abused by small boys on the
beach. Later while Ming Cho Yee fishes for squid at night, the
turtle returns, speaks to him, and invites him to Amovar, the
palace under the sea, ruled by a benevolent Empress assisted by her
beautiful daughter, the Princess.</p>

Yee finds love and happiness, marrying the Princess in the magical
realm of Amovar. But, after a short time, he feels he must return
to Point Alones to see his parents.</p>
<p>The Princess gives him a magic box to help him return to her,
and Ming Cho Yee finds himself on the beach at Point Alones again.
However, everything has changed. He is in present-day Pacific
Grove, during the Feast of Lanterns that celebrates the Chinese
squid fishermen of long ago.</p>
<p>Though Ming Cho Yee doesn&#x2019;t find the racism of the past, he
finds tourists and townspeople happy with the Chinese cultural
clich&#xE9;s being celebrated as fact, while a few protestors argue
against racial stereotyping. Ming Cho Yee now longs for the
undersea world and his love, the beautiful Princess. But in the
world of the present will discrimination and racial stereotyping
continue, or will we gradually come to respect and admire cultures
and social customs different from our own?</p>
<p>Admission is free. The play is recommended for adults and
children over 12. For further information, call Professor Shephard
