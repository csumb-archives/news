<p><img alt="Arienne Arreola" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/arienne_arreola_headshot.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:420px">Arienne Arreola, a
sophomore biology major from Bakersfield, is CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
2011 recipient of a William Randolph Hearst/CSU Trustees&#x2019; Award for
Outstanding Achievement. The award is among the CSU&#x2019;s highest
recognitions for student achievement.</p>
<p>Arienne and the other recipients were recognized at the CSU
Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach on Sept. 20.</p>
<p>The award is given to students who have overcome significant
challenges to demonstrate superior academic performance and
personal achievements and have demonstrated financial need.</p>
<p>Arienne wants to become a surgeon and be in a position to save
lives. This ambition comes from a deeply personal place &#x2013; when she
was 2 years old, her mother died of an aneurism while giving birth
to her younger brother. &#x201C;I believe her death would have been
preventable if she&#x2019;d received proper medical care,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Following her mother&#x2019;s death, her father left Arienne and her
four siblings in the care of her grandparents, both of whom were
fieldworkers. In middle school, she began acting out, and was
suspended. Soon after, a teacher intervened and helped Arienne
realize she wanted to put her life on a different course. She
changed her attitude and began taking school seriously. She found
she enjoyed the mental engagement classes offered, particularly
solving science and math problems. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like a game or puzzle to
me,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Arienne gained a strong work ethic from her grandparents, but
they had little experience or enthusiasm when it came to education.
She was determined, however, and became the first member of her
family to graduate from high school and attend college. She&#x2019;s on
track toward her goal, majoring in biology with a pre-med
concentration and a 3.5 grade-point average. She did this all while
working multiple jobs in order to support herself and help her
family.</p>
<p>More than 412,000 students attend the campuses of the CSU
system. Only 23 of those students are honored with Hearst
scholarships. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an
endowed scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain. In 1999, the foundation partnered with the CSU
Board of Trustees to supplement the endowment with contributions
from CSU Trustees and private donors.</p>
