<p>At Capitol Hill Ocean Week, held June 10-12, marine scientists
and others interested in the state of the world&#x2019;s oceans gathered
in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. James Lindholm" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/james.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:235px">Among them was CSU
Monterey Bay Professor James Lindholm, who was there on behalf of
the CSU Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology
(COAST).</p>
<p>He and several colleagues visited offices of elected officials
and federal agencies to discuss contributions that the CSU has made
to marine science.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW) has
brought together leaders in marine conservation, policy, science
and industry to tackle critical ocean issues. Hosted by the
National Marine Sanctuary Foundation, CHOW provides an annual forum
for discussions about the current state &#x2013; and future &#x2013; of our
oceans and coasts.</p>
<p>While in Washington, Dr. Lindholm participated in a panel
discussion on &#x201C;Blue News: Casting a Wider Net.&#x201D; He and several
panelists, including National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence
Sylvia Earle, discussed science communication and the need to
engage a wider audience while ensuring the information is accurate
and objective.</p>
