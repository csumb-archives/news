Along North Main Street in Salinas, 10 brightly colored banners
hang from atop light poles, each with its own story or message of
what it means to be a home owner. The banners, installed in front
of the Salinas Sports Complex, are the work of 17 digital public
art students at California State University, Monterey Bay. The work
is the result of a collaboration between the Department of Visual
and Public Art and the Center for Community Advocacy. &quot;In our
class, we aim for making art that the public has a role in
developing,&quot; said Gilbert Neri, a professor in the art department
who teaches the public art class.<br>
