<h3>Feb. 26 film showing, discussion will address the issue</h3>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 25
percent of college students have eating&#xA0;<img alt="Approximately 25 percent of college students have eating disorders" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/stigma_1.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:323px">disorders. The same
percent of college women report managing weight by binging and
purging, says the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders.</p>
<p>The problem is more widespread among women, but men aren&apos;t
immune. The association says 10 to 15 percent of people
experiencing anorexia or bulimia are male.<br>
<br>
To raise awareness of the issue, CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Health and
Wellness Services will observe National Eating Disorder Awareness
Week with a program on Feb. 26.<br>
<br>
Starting at 6:30 p.m. in the Black Box Cabaret, films culled from
Art With Impact&apos;s short film contest will be shown, followed by a
discussion and exploration of the ideas presented.<br>
<br>
Art With Impact is a San Francisco-based nonprofit that uses short
films to reduce the stigma around mental illness. Its mission is to
connect people to global issues through art and media and provide
opportunities to share their voices, time and talent in meaningful
ways.<br>
<br>
It selects and makes available some of the best short films on
mental health issues and then connects those films with educational
resources through events on college campuses.<br>
<br>
The Black Box Cabaret is located behind the Health and Wellness
Services Building at Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Fourth
Avenue.<br>
<br>
The public is invited to attend this free event, but a parking
permit must be purchased. Driving directoions and a campus map are
available at csumb.edu/maps.<br>
