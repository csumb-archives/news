<p>Dr. Suzy Worcester and John Inman, a graduate student in CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s applied marine and watershed science program, have
been working with Bruce Delgado at the Bureau of Land Management to
manage 2,500 acres of coastal grasslands at Fort Ord National
Monument.</p>

are relatively rare because of extensive human development along
California&apos;s coastline. The national monument&apos;s grasslands are home
to purple needle grass &#x2013; California&apos;s state grass &#x2013; and beautiful
blooms of spring wildflowers such as sky lupine.</p>
<p>When Fort Ord was a military reservation, the grasslands were
maintained using fire and grazing. However, since the base closed
in the early 1990s, coyote brush has slowly encroached into the
grasslands. Through ecological succession, these coastal grasslands
are being converted into coastal scrub.<br>
<br>
The Bureau of Land Managment has brought in sheep to graze the
grasslands; however, the coyote brush continues to spread. Delgado
believes that goats might be another way to remove the coyote brush
and manage the grasslands.<br>

Inman and Delgado have been working together to design an
experiment to test whether goat grazing is an effective way to
reduce coyote brush cover as well as to increase native grassland
species.</p>
<p>In an initial experiment last January, 1,400 goats ate the
coyote brush down to bare sticks in a 400-acre area. With the help
of BLM staff and volunteers, the investigators set up paired grazed
and control plots in dense stands of coyote brush throughout the
area before grazing started. Since coyote brush has the ability to
re-sprout, the plan is to continue to graze the experimental plots
annually until the coyote brush is killed.</p>
<p>The initial response was promising and the experiment will be
expanded substantially this year. It will be several years before
the results are known.</p>
