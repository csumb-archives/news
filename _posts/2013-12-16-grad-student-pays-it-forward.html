<h3>UROC propels Liz Lopez to master&apos;s program at USD</h3>
<p>Liz Lopez, a 2013 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay, has fit right in
at the University of San Diego, where she is pursuing a master&#x2019;s
degree in marine science.</p>
<p><img alt="Liz Lopez is studying marine science at USD" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/lopez-photo1_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:330px; height:210px">Last spring,
Lopez, Michael Diaz and Emily Roncase received National Science
Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships. Each was awarded $90,000
over three years.</p>
<p>For outstanding students in the sciences, the fellowships are a
golden ticket. The CSUMB students were among approximately 2,000
winners from a pool of more than 13,000 applicants nationwide.</p>
<p>Lopez credits the help she received through CSUMB&#x2019;s <a href="http://csumb.edu/uroc" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Center</a> with some of her success.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It catapulted me,&#x201D; she told <em>Inside USD</em>, a university
publication. &#x201C;It gave me the skills I needed to&#xA0;look for my
own opportunities, gave me a network and the chance to attend
conferences. If I hadn&#x2019;t been in the program, I wouldn&#x2019;t have known
to come here to USD,&#x201D; she added.</p>

is pursuing research that involves looking at the connection
between land and sea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never done terrestrial work before . . .but I look forward
to having an experience on land and being hands-on, even more so
than anything I&#x2019;ve done in the water,&#x201D; she told <em>Inside
USD</em>. She&#x2019;ll be working in Bahia de Los Angeles in Baja
California, an area that gives researchers opportunities with
various terrains in one large space.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;ll also work with high school students from San Diego&#x2019;s City
Heights, a diverse group of students who have developed a passion
for science through the Ocean Discovery Institute.</p>
<p>And she&#x2019;s lending a hand to the McNair Scholars program and a
chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native
Americans in Science (SACNAS).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Being a good scientist is important,&#x201D; she told <em>Inside
USD</em>, &#x201C;but being a good mentor is one of the reasons why I came
here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And that&#x2019;s something she learned through UROC, where her mentors
were CSUMB Professor James Lindholm, and Professor Sarah Henkel at
Oregon State University&#x2019;s Hatfield Marine Science Center.</p>
