resident received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from CSUMB in
September 2011, in recognition of his accomplishments as a
musician, inventor and sustainable energy pioneer.</p>
<p>Mr. Danziger worked at the California Institute of Technology&#x2019;s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he had a close-up look at one of
the space age&#x2019;s most ambitious projects, the Voyager exploration
into deep space.</p>
<p>While still in his 20s, he founded Sunlaw Energy Corp. His goal
was to research, develop, demonstrate and commercialize new energy
and environmental technology.</p>
<p>He has been issued 10 patents, including one for a &#x201C;walking
chair,&#x201D; which he uses to help overcome his own mobility issues.</p>
<p>And he&#x2019;s a law school graduate, an artist and musician. His
current project: rewriting Bach&#x2019;s Brandenburg Concertos, &#x201C;coming at
it from a jazz point of view,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The ceremony will be held at Freeman Stadium on the CSUMB
campus. Approximately 1,300 students will receive bachelor&#x2019;s and
master&#x2019;s degrees.<br>
