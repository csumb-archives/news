<p>Public invited to April 1 talk by Mark Mancina</p>
<p>Mark Mancina, best known for composing the music for the
Oscar-winning film Training Day, will lecture at California State
University, Monterey Bay on April 1.</p>
<p>Mancina will address students in the university&apos;s Music and
Performing Arts Department from 10 a.m. to noon in the Music Hall
on Sixth Avenue. The public is invited to this free event.</p>
<p>He will discuss his varied career, explain the process of
scoring a film from inception of musical ideas to final mix, talk
about how music serves the narrative, and discuss the importance of
capturing the emotional pace of a film while interpreting and
translating the director&#x2019;s vision.</p>
<p>Mancina has worked in almost every film genre: drama, action,
comedy, suspense and period epic. Among the other films he has
scored are Speed (1994), Moll Flanders (1996), Twister (1996),
August Rush (2007), Camille (2008), Shooter (2007).</p>
<p>His scores frequently feature his own performances on piano,
guitar, bass and percussion, highlighting unique sounds harvested
from his personal collection of instruments from around the
world.</p>
<p>Mancina has also composed music for television shows, including
the CBS drama Criminal Minds. And he added Broadway to his list of
accomplishments when he co-wrote songs, produced and arranged the
score for the musical production of The Lion King.</p>
<p>Along the way, he earned three Grammy awards, an American Music
Award, Britain&#x2019;s Ivor Novello Award and a Tony nomination.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at
