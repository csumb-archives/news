<strong><strong>Smoke coming our way from Soledad
fire</strong><br></strong>
<p>The smoke that is noticeable in the air today at CSUMB is coming
from the Gloria wildfire, which is burning between Soledad and
Gonzales in the Salinas Valley, approximately 30 miles from campus.
So far, the fire has consumed 5,000 acres.</p>
<p>The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District reports
that the smoke smell will be noticeable for a few hours; by
mid-afternoon the wind direction is expected to change, taking the
smoke out to the bay.</p>
<p>In the meantime, people with sensitivities to smoke may want to
stay indoors. Unusually sensitive people may consider reducing
prolonged or heavy exertion.</p>
