<h3>Iranian-born Taraneh Hemami visits CSUMB</h3>
<p>Iranian-born visual artist Taraneh Hemami has two homes &#x2013; and
she also has none. When Hemami&#xA0;<img alt="&apos;Free,&apos; on display at San Francisco&apos;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/free-neon300.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:200px">came to the United
States in 1978 to attend the University of Oregon, she planned to
return home after she finished school. Within a year, however, the
Iranian Revolution had changed her homeland forever and prevented
her from returning for more than a decade.</p>
<p><br>
As an Iranian living in the United States, it&apos;s not surprising that
Hemami&apos;s art would explore her complex relationship with the
concept of home and her struggle to secure a sense of belonging
from both her country of residence and her native country. In many
ways, Hemami&apos;s art is her home. &quot;There is a sense of satisfaction
in placing myself within the walls that I create,&quot; Hemami told
KQED&#x2019;s Quest program in an interview several years ago.</p>
<p>The local community will have the opportunity to learn about
Hemami&#x2019;s work when she visits CSU Monterey Bay on April 5. Her free
talk, part of the Visiting Artists Series, will start at 6 p.m. in
the&#xA0;<img alt="Taraneh Hemami" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/hemami.taraneh.jpg" style="float:right; width:233px; height:175px">University Center
ballroom. The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B
Street. Driving directions and a campus map can be found <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of her public art projects is currently on display at San
Francisco&#x2019;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The installation, on
display until August of 2013, is a neon sign with the word &#x201C;free&#x201D; &#x2013;
in English and Arabic &#x2013; repeated in a circle, acting, Hemami said,
as a prayer or chant. The English version, in blue, can be read
from the interior of the building; the Arabic version, in yellow,
can be read from outside.</p>
<p>Hemami told the San Francisco Chronicle that she surrounded the
neon with the geometric patterns one finds on the dome of a mosque
or bazaar. At the center of the pattern, in place of the dome&#x2019;s
peak, is the neon light calling for freedom.</p>
<p>Hemami&#x2019;s visit concludes the Visiting Artist Series for this
academic year.<br>
