<p>Earl Lawson is the university&#x2019;s new chief of police. Lawson
served in a number of important roles since joining the University
Police Department in 1995, most recently as operations lieutenant
and briefly as interim police chief upon the retirement of former
chief Fred Hardee last June.</p>
<p>President Dianne Harrison said Lawson was selected for the
breadth of his experience, which includes special training in
disaster preparedness and collaboration with local law
enforcement.</p>
<p>Lawson, who was sworn in Nov. 1, has a B.A. degree in sociology
from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. His extensive professional education
includes training at the FBI National Academy.</p>
