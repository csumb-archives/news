a professor in the College of Business at CSU Monterey Bay, has
been elected chair of the Grower-Shipper Association Foundation
board. She will serve a one-year term.<br>
<br>
The foundation is the non-profit arm of the Grower-Shipper
Association of Central California. It works to educate the
community about the agricultural industry.<br>
<br>
Its programs include AgKnowledge, an executive leadership program,
and A Greater Vision, a series of forums on agriculture-related
issues important to the community.<br>
<br>
Philanthropy is an important part of the foundation&#x2019;s mission. For
example, since June 2012, it has donated more than $75,000 to pay
for salad bars in Chualar, Gonzales, Greenfield, Monterey and
Salinas schools.<br>
<br>
Dr. Shockley joined CSUMB in 2006. She teaches management and
international business; her focus is on leadership, diversity and
corporate governance from a social responsibility perspective. She
holds a doctorate from the Said School of Business at Oxford
University, an M.S. from Stanford as a Sloan Fellow, and an MBA
from the University of Southern California.<br>
<br>
She has been a member of the Grower-Shipper Association Foundation
board for six years.<br>
