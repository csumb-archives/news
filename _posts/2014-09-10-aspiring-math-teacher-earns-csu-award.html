Bay sophomore Jesus Ochoa Perez has been chosen for a CSU Trustees&apos;
Award for Outstanding Achievement. He and the other award winners
will be honored on Sept. 9 at the CSU board meeting in Long
Beach.</p>
<p>The award is among the highest student distinctions in the CSU
and is accompanied by a scholarship. Awardees must demonstrate
superior academic performance, personal accomplishments, community
service and financial need. Many of the honorees have prevailed in
the face of disability, language and cultural barriers, intense
personal loss or homelessness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The compelling life stories of these extraordinary student
scholars are a testament to the transformative power of public
higher education,&#x201D; said CSU Chancellor Timothy P. White. &#x201C;Through
the generous support of our donors, many of whom are first-time
contributors to the Trustees&#x2019; Award program, we are able to help
these scholars create a bright and successful future.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jesus lived with his parents and three siblings in one room
during part of his childhood, leaving him no quiet place to study.
His parents, farm workers from Mexico, were determined that their
children would not face the financial hardships and the physical
ills of working in the fields.</p>
<p class="pullquote"><em>I want to help others develop their love
for math. I will do everything in my power to provide a learning
environment that is conducive to the needs of students.</em><br>
&#x2013; Jesus Ochoa Perez</p>
<p>This semester, Jesus is starting his second year at CSUMB, where
he is a math major with a 4.0 grade-point average. A service
learning requirement led him to an elementary school where he
tutored first-graders in math &#x2013; and discovered his passion for
teaching. He volunteered far more than the number of hours required
and continues to tutor elementary school students. He also found
time to be a volunteer youth soccer coach.</p>
<p>Jesus is determined to be a success story from his East Salinas
neighborhood by earning a teaching credential and returning to his
high school to teach math.</p>
<p>Almost 447,000 students attend the 23 campuses of the CSU
system. Only one student from each campus is honored with the
Trustees&#x2019; Award. The program began three decades ago with
scholarships endowed by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
Since then, the generosity of current and emeritus CSU trustees and
other supporters of the university has allowed the program to
expand.</p>
<p>CSU Trustees&#x2019; Scholars are nominated by their campus
presidents.</p>
