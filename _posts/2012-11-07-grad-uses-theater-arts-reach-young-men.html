<p>Gilbert Salazar was born to work with young people. He has spent
years teaching, guiding and mentoring them in a variety of
settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Gilbert Salazar" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/salazar_gilbert.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:267px">Now the former
Service Learning Student Leader and 2008 graduate of CSU Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s integrated studies special major is headed to the University
of Southern California to pursue a Master of Arts degree in applied
theater arts. The program appeals to him because he believes
theater can be used to address social issues.</p>
<p>Since graduating, Salazar has worked with at-risk youth at
Sunrise House in Salinas in a program called Youth Alternatives to
Violence; as a youth coordinator for the United Way; and at the
Monterey County Rape Crisis Center, where he teaches MyStrengh
classes.</p>
<p>MyStrength is a statewide program that targets young men between
the ages of 14 and 18, empowering them to speak out against sexual
violence.</p>
<p>Through his work with the Rape Crisis Center, he also visits
middle and high schools, teaching about sexual harassment and
assault in order to prevent sexual violence.</p>
<p>Skits and role-playing figure in his work, and he&#x2019;s eager to
learn how to better develop and facilitate those activities.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s my intent with the applied theater arts program to move
males away from harmful behaviors and activities and toward
masculine identities that are less harmful, less violent,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>He sees it as a continuation of the work he did for his capstone
project at CSUMB, where he developed a curriculum to prevent
adolescent male violence.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to move forward with a curriculum to be included in the
burgeoning fields of masculinity studies and gender studies,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Last year, my work was recognized. I was interviewed by USC
sociology professor Michael Messner for an anthology about men who
work in the violence prevention movement.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s quick to point out that applied theater arts is not about
staging a production; it&#x2019;s about education and creating change.</p>
<p>And that&#x2019;s a challenge he&#x2019;s eager to embrace.</p>
