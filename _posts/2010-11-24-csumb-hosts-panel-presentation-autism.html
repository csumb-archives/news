<h4>Local resources for parents, teachers is topic of Dec. 1
event</h4>
<p>With the diagnosis rate estimated to be 1 in 110 children, it&#x2019;s
imperative that parents and teachers of students with autism know
what local resources are available.</p>
<p>That topic will be addressed at Cal State Monterey Bay on Dec. 1
when the university&#x2019;s chapter of the Council for Exceptional
Children and the state CEC sponsor a free panel discussion from
5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Meeting the Needs of Students with Autism: Community
Perspectives&#x201D; will feature panelists Laura Harris, executive
director of local nonprofit Special Kids Crusade; Stella Lauerman,
community services manager of Easter Seals Central California; and
Marcia Weber-Olsen, program specialist with Monterey County&#x2019;s
Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).</p>
<p>Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor of special education at
CSUMB, will be the moderator.</p>
<p>Students, parents, teachers and community members with an
interest in autism are invited to attend. A light dinner will be
provided.</p>
<p>Please RSVP to Jacquelline Means at 582-4612. For more
information, contact Dr. Cathi Draper Rodriguez at 582-3652.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at
csumb.edu/map.</p>
