The memories are clouded by time and dead brain cells, but I
remember my college dining hall as a belly-busting shirine to lard
and carbs. The highlight of the week came Friday when we choked
down a gristly steak and mounds of mac &apos;n&apos; cheese. In stark
contrast is the dining experience at California State University,
Montery Bay, where students dine on oganic salad greens and fruit,
lemon-herb chicken with sun-dried tomato basil couscous or Monterey
Bay salmon with Cajun spices and lemon caper aioli.<br>
