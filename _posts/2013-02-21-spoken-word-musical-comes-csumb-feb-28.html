<p>In celebration of Black History Month, NuBiAh, a
Broadway-caliber musical, will be staged at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
World Theater on Feb. 28 at 7 p.m.</p>
<p><img alt="NuBiAh comes to campus Feb. 28" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/nubiah_flyer_final.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:464px">NuBiAh is a
spoken-word musical that dramatizes the history of African kings
and queens, with an emphasis on the strong principles and character
traits that made them legendary. The play is based on a bedtime
story and a coloring book written by Tommy Jones.<br>
<br>
Jones is executive producer and artistic director of the stage
play. His impetus for writing the musical was a desire to give
African American children and young adults a keener sense of
identity and self-worth.<br>
<br>
The play features original choreography, music, dance, and
spoken-word poetry. The play aims to inspire the audience members
to find their passion and follow their dream.<br>
<br>
The event is sponsored by CSUMB&#x2019;s Otter Cross Cultural Center and
Associated Students.<br>
<br>
The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue. &#xA0;While the
performance is free,&#xA0;<img alt="NuBiAh tells the story of African kings and queens" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/nubia_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:267px">visitors must
