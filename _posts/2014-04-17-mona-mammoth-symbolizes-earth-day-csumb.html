<p>A long-extinct creature roams the earth &#x2013; at least CSUMB&apos;s piece
of it &#x2013; once again.<br>

part of&#xA0;<a href="../14/csumb-goes-green-earth-day-events.html" rel="nofollow">CSUMB&apos;s celebration of Earth Day</a>, and will
remain on display through May 17.</p>
<p>The public art piece is a project of the university&apos;s Visual and
Public Art (VPA) Department and the Associated Students
Environmental Affairs Committee. The theme was chosen because of
its association with global warming, which contributed to the
extinction of the animal. The mammoth is, quite literally, the
elephant in the room.<br>
<br>
The project was meant to stimulate a discussion about the
importance of public art as well as to create a dialogue about
global and community concerns.</p>
<p>The 12-foot by 16-foot sculpture &#x2013; made of a wooden
understructure and mostly recycled, repurposed materials &#x2013; took
about 12 weeks to complete. During that time, VPA faculty member
Dio Mendoza and instructional technician Steev White worked on it
almost continuously. Students and community members also
participated.</p>
<p>Public events:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Mammoth tour and artists&apos; presentations<br>
April 22, 4-5 p.m.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Relocation reception<br>
May 17, noon-2:30 p.m.</p>
