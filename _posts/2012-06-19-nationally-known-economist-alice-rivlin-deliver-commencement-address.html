a member of President Barack Obama&apos;s National Commission on
Fiscal&#xA0;Responsibility and Reform, founding director of the
Congressional Budget Office and a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, will deliver the keynote address at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
commencement ceremony on May 19.</p>
<p>As part of the ceremony, Dr. Rivlin will be awarded an honorary
Doctor of Laws degree.<br>
<br>
Dr. Rivlin served as the first director of the Congressional Budget
Office from 1975 to 1983. During the Clinton administration, she
was director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1994 to
1996, becoming the first woman to hold the Cabinet-level
position.<br>
<br>
She served as governor and vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve
from 1996 to 1999.<br>
&#x201C;CSU Monterey Bay is very pleased to have a commencement speaker of
such national prominence,&#x201D; President Dianne Harrison said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She has played an important role in some of the most important
economic decisions affecting our country,&quot; Dr. Harrison said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Given the current economic conditions, I cannot imagine better
timing for our students to hear from Dr. Rivlin. I am confident
that our faculty and students will come away with a better
understanding of the forces shaping our future economic
outlook.&quot;<br>
<br>
Known for her effectiveness in working in a bipartisan manner, Dr.
Rivlin is a key participant in the effort to curb the deficit and
overhaul the tax code. In February, the Washington Post called her
&#x201C;the budget wonk&apos;s budget wonk.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She was appointed by President Obama to the Commission on Fiscal
Responsibility and Reform, co-chaired by Democrat Erskine Bowles
and Republican Alan Simpson. Two years ago, the commission
recommended an overhaul of the U.S. tax code that would lower rates
and raise net revenue in order the trim the deficit.<br>
<br>
Dr. Rivlin also co-chaired with former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
the Bipartisan Policy Center&apos;s Task Force on Debt Reduction. From
1998 to 2001, she chaired the District of Columbia Financial
Management Assistance Authority.<br>
<br>
A frequent contributor to newspapers and television news programs,
Dr. Rivlin is a regular contributor to the &quot;Nightly Business
Report&quot; on PBS. Her books include &quot;Systematic Thinking for Social
Action&quot; (1971), &quot;Reviving the American Dream&quot; (1992) and &quot;Beyond
the Dot.coms&quot; (2001).<br>
She is co-author of &quot;Restoring Fiscal Sanity: How to Balance the
Budget&quot; (2004) and other books.<br>
<br>
Dr. Rivlin is a visiting professor at the Public Policy Institute
of Georgetown University and a researcher at the Washington,
D.C.-based Brookings Institute (she led its Economic Studies
Program from 1983 to 1987). She also has taught at Harvard, George
Mason University and The New School universities.<br>
<br>
She has a bachelor&apos;s degree from Bryn Mawr College and a doctorate
from Radcliffe College at Harvard University, both in
