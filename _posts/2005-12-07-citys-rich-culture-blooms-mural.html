Until now, Johanna Poethig had never painted a public mural in
Chicago, where she lived after arriving from the Philippines at age
15 and to which she credits her artistic roots. &quot;This is my first
mural in Chicago except for my bedroom wall,&quot; jokes the
internationally exhibited artist, who now calls California home.
Poethig designed and led the painting of &quot;Loop Tattoo,&quot; a
6,500-square-foot community mural soon to cover the brick,
windowless side of 63 E. Lake St., just off Michigan Avenue.
Poethig&apos;s beliefs sync with the social mission of public art &#x2013; to
claim public spaces and transform them &#x2013; principles she teaches at
the Visual and Public Art Department at California State
University, Monterey Bay.<br>
