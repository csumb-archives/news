<p>His student-athletes usually take center stage, but CSUMB&#x2019;s
Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal recently took a bit of the
spotlight himself, bringing more national recognition to the Otter
program by being named to the National Association of Collegiate
Directors of Athletics (NACDA) executive committee.</p>
<p>NACDA is the professional and educational association for more
than 6,500 college athletics administrators at more than 1,600
institutions throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To be able to serve in this capacity and represent Cal State
Monterey Bay on a national level is a great honor,&#x201D; said Otoupal,
who becomes just the ninth California Collegiate Athletic
Association administrator to sit on the committee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The support of our university leadership is an important part
of Otter Athletics&apos; success and I thank them for that. This is
another &apos;victory&apos; for CSUMB. I look forward to making a positive
impact on the future of intercollegiate athletics and learning ways
to better serve CSUMB.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said UCLA Director of Athletics and incoming NACDA president Dan
Guerrero: &#x201C;The NACDA Executive Committee continually features some
of the best administrators in college athletics. The recent
addition Vince Otoupal carries on the strong tradition and legacy
of outstanding leadership in this prestigious group.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Otoupal will serve a term that runs through 2015.<br>
