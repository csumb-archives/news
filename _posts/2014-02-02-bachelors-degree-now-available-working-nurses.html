<h3>Class schedule accommodates employed professionals</h3>
<p><br>
To help meet a growing demand for nurses with bachelor&#x2019;s degrees,
CSU Monterey Bay started a nursing program in 2012, partnering with
four local community colleges.</p>
<p><img alt="Nursing make a difference" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/nursing_image.jpeg" style="float:left; width:280px; height:180px">Starting in June,
the program will add a tract for already-employed nurses with
associate&#x2019;s degrees who want to earn a bachelor&#x2019;s while they
continue to work.</p>
<p>Classes will be held in the late afternoons and evenings; some
will be traditional face-to-face classes, some will be online.</p>
<p>The curriculum will include courses on research methods,
evidence-based practice, health policy, informatics, genomics and
chronic care management.</p>
<p>The plan is to enroll 35 students in the first class. Students
will take classes in the summer, fall, spring and summer 2015
sessions and can graduate in 14 months &#x2013; if they have completed all
general education requirements before enrolling at CSUMB.</p>
<p>In addition to nurses who are currently employed, the program
will admit recent community college nursing graduates. &#x201C;The idea is
for a seamless transition from community college to CSUMB,&#x201D; said
Dr. Marianne Hultgren, interim director of nursing.</p>
<p>In a 2010 report, &#x201C;The Future of Nursing: Leading Change,
Advancing Health,&#x201D; the Institute of Medicine and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation examined future demands. The report suggested
that the proportion of nurses with bachelor&#x2019;s degrees increase to
80 percent by 2020 in order to meet the demands of an evolving
health care system and meet the changing needs of patients. Today,
only 30 percent of California nurses have four-year degrees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We need to partner with health care organizations and be
responsive to their needs,&#x201D; Dr. Hultgren said.</p>
