Armed with spray paint, plastic gloves and garbage bags, about 75
new students from California State University, Monterey Bay
descended on Natividad Creek Park in north Salinas on Saturday.
Their goal? Remove some of the hundreds of pounds of litter in and
around the park while educating parkgoers and neighborhood
residents about the creek&apos;s role in ocean health.<br>
