<p>Enid Baxter Blader is the co-editor of a series of 22
contemporary projects that explore California and its troubled
relationship with water.</p>
<p>Water, CA is a multimedia &#x201C;experiment in geography&#x201D; that helps
visitors to its website understand the complex story of water in
the Golden State through essays, paintings, photography, video
animations and a water timeline.</p>
<p>Blader, chair of the Department of Teledramatic Arts and
Technology, and her co-editor, artist Nicole Antebi, say the
projects create a new way of navigating California&#x2019;s landscape.
Erasing the traditional map, tied together by counties and towns,
the state can be drawn by waterways, watersheds, reclamations,
deprivations . . .&#xA0; connecting seemingly disparate bodies.</p>
<p>Blader wrote and illustrated two of the entries, one examining
the Central Valley and discussing the cultural divide at the heart
of the battle over California&#x2019;s water, the other looking at the
history of the Salinas River.</p>

fall of 2011 at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento.</p>
