What began as a dispute over who should pay for road improvements
in Monterey County has become a pivotal court battle pitting the
state&apos;s cities and counties against an equally powerful array of
public colleges and universities. At stake when the state Supreme
Court rules is who should pay for new off-campus costs - such as
local transportation and firefighting improvements - that are
required when public colleges decide to expand.<br>
