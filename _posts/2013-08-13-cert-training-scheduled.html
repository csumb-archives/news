<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/cert_logo.jpeg" style="float:right; width:296px; height:170px">When disaster
strikes, Community Emergency Response Teams &#x2013; or CERTS &#x2013; step in to
assist, helping communities respond to and recover from the
emergency.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is recruiting volunteers to help fill this
critical role.</p>
<p>Members of the community are invited to attend the entry-level
20-hour CERT class Sept. 6 through 8 on campus. The free class,
offered in cooperation with Central Coast CERT and the Monterey
County Office of Emergency Services, will be held in the Emergency
Operations Center located in the Police Department:</p>
<p>&#x2022; 3-7 pm., Friday, Sept. 6 and<br>
&#x2022; 9 a.m.-4 p.m., Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 7 and 8</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>CERT classes are a combination of lecture and hands-on training,
and include light search and rescue, disaster medical operations,
and CERT team organization. Among other skills, participants learn
how to use hand-held radios, shut off gas and operate a fire
extinguisher.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion, participants will receive
certification as a CERT member and will be eligible to register as
Disaster Service Workers.</p>
<p>While the university is building the <a href="http://police.csumb.edu/cert" rel="nofollow">Otter CERT team</a>,
the training is open to anyone in Monterey County. Upon completion
of the training, community members will be able to join one of the
local CERT teams active in the area.</p>
<p>For more information or to register, please contact CSUMB&#x2019;s
emergency manager Dick Bower at 582-3589 or <a href="mailto:dbower@csumb.edu">dbower@csumb.edu</a>, or Arianne Tucker,
the university&#x2019;s health and safety specialist, at 582-4096 or
