<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Master of Social Work program is accepting
applications for Fall 2011. Application deadline is Jan. 31</p>
<p>The program provides an opportunity for people who are
interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance in
their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is both
accessible and affordable. It is intended to address a chronic
shortage of professionally trained social workers in the tri-county
area, especially those who are bilingual and bicultural.</p>
<p>Classes are small and personal, and are offered in the evenings.
The three-year program allows students to concentrate in either
Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families. Students must
also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per
semester starting in the second year.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Vivienne Orgel at 582-5315.
Admission requirements and application materials are available

<p>An information session to learn more about the program is
scheduled for Jan. 20, noon to 1 p.m. in Beach Hall. Driving
directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Last fall&apos;s inaugural class numbered 41 students. Ninety-five
percent of them come from Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito
counties; 10 percent are employed by one of those counties; most
are female; and 40 percent are bilingual.&#xA0; Nearly 70 percent
earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in the last five years and nearly 60
percent are under the age of 30.</p>
