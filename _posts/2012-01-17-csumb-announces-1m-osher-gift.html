<h3>OLLI&apos;s adult education classes resume in January</h3>
<p>The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at CSU Monterey Bay, also
known as OLLI@CSUMB, has been awarded $1 million by the Bernard
Osher Foundation.<br>
<br>
<img alt="OLLI spring catalog is available online at olli.csumb.edu/courses" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/olli_spring2012_thumbnail.jpg" style="float:left; width:275px; height:356px">The foundation,
which since 2006 has supported OLLI at CSUMB with annual grants,
contributed both a permanent endowment of $950,000 and a $50,000
operating grant for the current fiscal year.<br>
<br>
Investment income from the endowment will help fund OLLI
operations, though community involvement and support will remain
vital to the program&#x2019;s continued success.<br>
<br>
The Osher gift recognizes OLLI&#x2019;s ability to sustain membership
growth, include university faculty members among its course
instructors, and remain strong in the future. OLLI now has a
community of 500 members, up from 100 members at the end of its
first year, in spring 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;This generous support from the Osher Foundation will help us
continue to fulfill an important part of our mission as a
university,&quot; said CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison.
&quot;Adult education is one of the many important ways we contribute to
the quality of life in the communities we serve.&quot;</p>
<p>OLLI invites local residents 50-and-better to join. The spring
session will start on Jan. 17 and continue through May. Several
membership options are available.&#x2028;</p>
<p>Classes include a look at California&#x2019;s role in the 2012
presidential primary, taught by Fred Keeley; a variety of writing
classes; beginning nature photography taught by CSUMB biology
professor Steve Moore; getting to know native plants, taught by
staff members of the university&#x2019;s Return of the Natives restoration
education project; early Central Coast art, taught by museum
studies professor Lila Staples; and several literature classes.</p>
<p>The complete spring lineup of classes is now available <a href="http://olli.csumb.edu/courses" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</p>
