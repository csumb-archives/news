<h3>Student capstones on display at Steinbeck Center</h3>
<p>While most capstone projects are displayed during the
end-of-semester campus-wide festival at Cal State Monterey Bay, for
years a few have been exhibited at the National Steinbeck Center in
Salinas.</p>
<p>This year, the center showcased the work of three Visual and
Public Art students, two Human Communication students and an
Integrated Studies major who combined art and psychology.</p>
<p><img alt="Painting by a solider stationed at Fort Ord" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kristin_brown_2jpg.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:532px">&#x201C;The students
conceptualize, design, create and install their work for public
viewing,&#x201D; said Deborah Silguero, curator of exhibitions and
collections and a lecturer in CSUMB&#x2019;s museum studies program. &#x201C;This
is their first time presenting in a museum setting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The exhibit, &#x201C;We See It This Way,&#x201D; opened in conjunction with
the annual Steinbeck Festival in early May. It will remain on
display through June.</p>
<p>Visual and Public Art student Kirsten Brown&#x2019;s curatorial
project, &#x201C;Creativity in Camouflage: Soldier Art and the Matter of
Morale,&#x201D; represents a connection between the Central Coast&#x2019;s art
and military histories and provides a look at military training
from a psychological point of view.</p>
<p>Vietnam-era soldiers in Fort Ord&#x2019;s arts and crafts program
created the artwork in her exhibit. Most of the artists are
unknown.</p>
<p>Other capstones in the exhibit include:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Stacey Limone (VPA), Light Alchemy: Photographic
Representations of Spiritual Transformation</p>
<p>&#x2022; Emily Thompson (Integrated Studies), Things Concealed: Art as
Therapy</p>
<p>&#x2022; Alyssa Thompson (VPA), Salinas: What&#x2019;s the Object?</p>
<p>&#x2022; Sarah Hollingsworth and Veronica Griffith (HCom), Oral
Histories of Chinatown: Embracing the Street</p>
<p>Photographs by Monterey Peninsula College student Patrick Russo
are also included in the exhibit.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I see the students go from being somewhat overwhelmed with
anxiety to overjoyed with personal success,&#x201D; Silguero said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud to say that many of these students go successfully
off to work in the museum field, education and art.&#x201D;</p>
