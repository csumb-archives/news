<p>Taiwan-based performance group A Moving Sound will pay a visit
to CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Showtime is 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p><img alt="A Moving Sound" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/amovingsound_group_photo_1.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:287px">Founded in 2001 by
composer and performer Scott Prairie, the group has performed in 15
countries and been featured on the Discovery Channel and Huffington
Post.</p>
<p>Prairie and his five-member band explore a new musical
expression that fuses Taiwanese, Chinese and neighboring Asian
musical ideas in modern song compositions. Songs are performed on
Chinese instruments accompanied by the vocals and dance of lead
singer Mia Hsieh, transporting listeners to and beyond the Far
East.</p>
<p>The group is active in the Asian-Pacific region, performing at
concerts and festivals, offering workshops and collaborating with
artists from all over the world.</p>
<p>In the decade since the group was formed, it has released three
albums and has been featured in a special program on Taipei
presented by the Lonely Planet television series. Tom Pryor,
supervisor of National Geographic World Music, described them as
&quot;one of the most original outfits working in the world music arena
today.&quot;</p>
<p>Tickets are $15 for general admission, $10 for CSUMB faculty and
staff, free for CSUMB students and are available at the Student
Center and at the World Theater box office. To reserve tickets, or
for more information, call 582-4580.</p>
