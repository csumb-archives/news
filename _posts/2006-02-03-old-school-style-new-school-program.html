Cal State-Monterey Bay catcher Alex Swartz says the Otters baseball
team is &quot;old school,&quot; but the jargon sounds odd. The school is
fielding a team for the first time in school history. It&apos;s home
diamond, along with the rest of campus, resides on the former Fort
Ord, a long-time military base selected for decommissioning in
1991.<br>
