<h3>&apos;Greater Vision&apos; forum looks at public health and
agriculture</h3>
<p>The &#x201C;Greater Vision&#x201D; series of public forums on topics important
to local agriculture and the larger community continues Oct. 22 at
California State University, Monterey Bay. The topic is &#x201C;The
Business of Healthy Eating.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Central Coast agriculture grows fruits and vegetables
recommended for a healthy diet. The agriculture industry and public
health are working together to protect the environment and prevent
diseases such as diabetes. A public-private partnership, uneasy at
times, is emerging to address this challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="lettuce" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/lettuce_mix.jpg" style="width:350px; height:263px; float:left">This series will
address how the systems of production agriculture and the promotion
of public health can work together to provide value-added produce
at an affordable price while protecting farm workers and the
environment. In three annual sessions, experts will examine this
challenge and how it can be addressed through public policy,
marketing programs designed to promote the public good, and new
production technologies</p>
<p>Congressman Sam Farr will deliver the keynote address, &#x201C;Healthy,
Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.&#x201D; A panel discussion will follow;
panelists include CSUMB professors Brad Barbeau and Trish Sevene;
Dr. Lorelei DiSogra of the United Fresh Produce Association; Dr.
Edward Moreno, director of public health for Monterey County; and
Gina Nucci of Mann Packing.</p>
<p>The event will be held in the University Center on Sixth Avenue
and B Street, starting at 2 p.m. The event is free; however, a
parking permit must be purchased from the machine on the lot.
