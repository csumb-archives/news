<h3>College students aren&#x2019;t the only ones being educated on the Cal
State Monterey Bay campus</h3>
<p>What do Hamlet, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and music&#x2019;s Romantic Period
have in common?</p>
<p>They are among a diverse range of classes that will be offered
in the spring through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI
&#x2013; at California State University, Monterey Bay. The courses and
speakers are specifically geared for those 50 and better.</p>

Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher Foundation, is
part of a national network that recognizes learning and exploration
have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a fresh look at
themselves, their world, and the possibilities that await them.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are a variety of writing classes; an
examination of David Foster Wallace&#x2019;s novel Infinite Jest; the spy
novels of Graham Greene and Joseph Conrad; Steinbeck&#x2019;s Mexico; and
the wildflowers of spring</p>
<p>New this semester is a look at the near-collapse of the U.S.
financial system; an exploration of the literary origins of
Frankenstein&#x2019;s monster; and an introduction to our &#x201C;new ocean,&#x201D;
drastically altered by higher carbon content, warmer temperatures
and reduced oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a three-session
class, California Politics: Incubator of Change, that will look at
the state&#x2019;s trend-setting policies and politics in what could be a
history-making period for the Golden State.</p>
<p>Also offered is a talk on local environmental issues with Dr.
Doug Smith, professor and chair of the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy at CSUMB.</p>
<p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can
sign up for a spring semester membership &#x2013; which includes up to
three courses for $105. Membership includes discounts on World
Theater and athletic events on campus.</p>
