The problem with student fund-raisers is that no matter how noble
the cause, car washes and bake sales can only get you so far. Jesus
Ruvalcaba, an outreach specialist with CSUMB&apos;s Educational Talent
Search who has worked to get high school students into college,
came up with the idea for a comedy show but wasn&apos;t sure how to
proceed. He contacted comedians online; they agreed to help. So did
the Associated Students, who offered to fund the concert. A
bona-fide student-run event came to life.<br>
