<p>To commemorate Constitution Day, California State University,
Monterey Bay Professor David Reichard will present a talk on the
topic &#x201C;Beyond 5 to 4: Understanding How Supreme Court Justices
Interpret the Constitution and Why it Matters,&#x201D; at 8 p.m., Sept.
17.</p>
<p>The talk will be held in the University Center living room. The
University Center is located on Sixth Avenue and B Street. Driving
directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/maps.</p>
<p>While the event is free, a parking permit must be purchased from
a machine on the lot.</p>
<p>Please RSVP to Brendan Taylor at <a href="mailto:bretaylor@csumb.edu">bretaylor@csumb.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Constitution Day programs have been required since 2004, when an
appropriations bill approved by Congress contained a requirement
that every school or university that receives federal money present
an annual program on the Constitution.</p>
