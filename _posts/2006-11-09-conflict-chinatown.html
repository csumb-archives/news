Salinas&apos; Soledad Street has been a refuge for the hungry and
homeless for more than two decades. For the past decade, CSUMB has
been sending students to Dorothy&apos;s Place to do the service learning
work that every student at the university is required to do. Over
the last five years, students have been putting in a combined 3,000
volunteer hours a year on Soledad Street, says Seth Pollack ,
director of CSUMB&apos;s Service Learning Institute.<br>
