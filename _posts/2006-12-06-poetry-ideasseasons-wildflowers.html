<p>A large, colorful mural, called Poetry of Ideas/Seasons of
Wildflowers was recently installed on one of the walls in the
public portion of the building.</p>
<p>The design connects the seasons of growth between nature and
students in their exchange of ideas and experiences. The
wildflowers are found in the Monterey area and represent the
uniqueness and individualism of the students united in one garden.
Wildflowers grow, reach their potential, and release seeds for the
next season of flowers. Students also grow while attending the
university, exchange ideas and leave their mark for the next
generation.</p>
<p>The campus is invited to attend a public dedication of the mural
at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 12.</p>
